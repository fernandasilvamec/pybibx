	abstract = {Wireless methodologies are the focal point of electronic devices, including telephones, computers, sensors, mobile phones, laptops, and wearables. However, wireless technology is not yet utilized extensively in underwater and deep-space communications applications, and it is also not applied in certain critical medical, military, and industrial applications due to its limited battery life. Self-energy-harvesting techniques overcome this issue by converting ambient energy from the surroundings into usable power for electronic devices; devices that use such techniques are next-generation wireless devices that can operate without relying on external power sources. This methodology improves the sustainability of the wireless device and ensures its prolonged operation. This article gives an in-depth analysis of the recent techniques that are implemented to design an efficient energy-harvesting wireless device. It also summarizes the most preferred energy sources and generator systems in the present trends. This review and its summary explore the common scope of researchers in narrowing their focus in designing new self-energy-harvesting wireless devices. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The specific objective of this study is to find a suitable artificial neural network model for estimating the operation indicators (disturbed soil volume, effective field capacity, draft force, and energy requirement) of ploughing units (tractor disc) in various soil conditions. The experiment involved two different factors, i.e., (I) soil texture index and (I) field work index, and included soil moisture content, tractor engine power, soil bulk density, tillage speed, tillage depth, and tillage width, which were linked to one dimensionless index. We assessed the effectiveness of artificial neural network and multiple linear regression models between the values predicted and the actual values using the mean absolute error criterion to test data points. When the artificial neural network model was applied, the mean absolute error values for disturbed soil volume, effective field capacity, draft force, and energy requirement were 69.41 m3·hr-1, 0.04 ha·hr-1, 1.24 kN, and 1.95 kw·hr·ha-1, respectively. In order to evaluate the behaviour of new models, the coefficient R2 was used as a criterion, where R2 values in artificial neural network were 0.9872, 0.9553, 0.9948, and 0.9718, respectively, for the aforementioned testing dataset. Simultaneously, R2 values in multiple linear regression were 0.7623, 0.696, 0.492, and 0.5572, respectively, for the same testing dataset. Based on these comparisons, it was clear that predictions using the artificial neural network models proposed are very satisfactory.  © 2023 Ghazwan A. Dahham et al., published by Sciendo.},

This technology involves a series of coupled processes occurring at distinct length scales, ranging from nanometer to meter and even larger, including water sorption/desorption at the nanoscale, condensation at the mesoscale, device development at the macroscale and water scarcity assessment at the global scale. Comprehensive understanding and bespoke designs at every scale are thus needed to improve the water-harvesting performance. For this purpose, a brief introduction of the global water crisis and its key characteristics is provided to clarify the impact potential and design criteria of water harvesters. Next the latest molecular-level optimizations of sorbents for efficient moisture capture and release are discussed. Then, novel microstructuring of surfaces to enhance dropwise condensation, which is favorable for atmospheric water generation, is shown. After that, system-level optimizations of sorbent-assisted water harvesters to achieve high-yield, energy-efficient, and low-cost water harvesting are highlighted.

	abstract = {Co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal presents a promising opportunity for large-scale biomass utilization while reducing fossil fuel consumption. However, this process is highly complex and influenced by various factors, including the physicochemical properties of biomass and coal, their blending ratio, and operating parameters. To effectively comprehend and optimize the biomass-coal co-pyrolysis process, many experiments are required to achieve the desired product quantity and quality. In addressing this challenge, machine learning technology emerges as a valuable solution, as it can learn the relationships between input and output variables from available examples without explicit knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. This study conducts a comprehensive literature review to establish an extensive database encompassing biomass-coal compositions and pyrolysis reaction conditions. Using the collected data, robust statistical analyses are applied to understand better the underlying mechanisms governing the biomass-coal co-pyrolysis process. Four machine learning methods, namely support vector regression, artificial neural network, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression, are employed to model the process. The best-performing model is subjected to an extensive feature importance analysis to identify the essential input features associated with each output response. The gradient boosting regression technique demonstrates superior performance with excellent results, characterized by higher coefficients of determination (R2 > 0.96) and lower errors (RMSE < 3.01 and MAE < 2.27). The temperature range of 450 to 550 °C, biomass blending ratios between 30 and 60%, and heating rates of 30 to 50 °C/min were identified as the conditions that maximize pyrolysis oil yield. Furthermore, the feature importance analysis reveals that the operating temperature and the biomass blending ratio are the most significant descriptors in the biomass-coal co-pyrolysis process. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The energy crisis and depleting fossil fuel resources have always been the focus of researchers. Fuel consumption of agricultural tractors is not an exception. Researchers have used different methods to predict fuel consumption. With the development of artificial intelligence in the last decade, all re-searchers’ attention has been directed towards it. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which was inspired by the data processing patterns in the human brain. The deep learning method has been used in research due to the advantages of high accuracy and generalization. So far, no research has used this method to predict fuel consumption. In this research, field experiments were carried out in sandy clay loam and clay soils to model the temporal fuel consumption and specific fuel consumption of an agricultural tractor using a convolutional neural network (CNN), while having some parameters such as the soil type, soil conditions, tool parameters, and operation pa-rameters. The experiments were conducted within each soil texture in a factorial manner based on the randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. For each soil texture, various moisture levels (8–17% for dry and 18–40% for moist soils), tractor forward speeds (1.2, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.2 km h−1), working depths (30 and 50 cm), the number of passes (2 and 6), and tire inflation pressure (20 and 25 psi) were selected, and cone index, dynamic load, and moisture content were measured in each experimental section. The designed networks used to predict the instant fuel consumption were of a CNN type. The results indicated that the network developed based on the Sgdm algorithm outperformed the others, and thus it was selected for modeling purposes. The network was evaluated based on R2 and MSE criteria. For the temporal fuel consumption, the best results were obtained while using 8-510-510-1 architecture with R2 = 0.9729 and MSE = 0.0049. The 8-100-95-1 architecture also led to the best prediction of the specific fuel consumption with R2 of 0.9737 and MSE of 0.0054. The high prediction accuracy and low error in this research compared to previous studies indicate the superiority of this method in order to predict fuel consumption. It was also observed from the results that the input parameters, which include soil, tool, and operational parameters, are all effective on fuel consumption. Proper management of some parameters, such as working depth, tire inflation pressure, and forward speed, can help to optimize fuel consumption. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Tire pressure state is crucial for driving performance and fuel efficiency and is the welfare of the driver. Tire inflation pressure greatly affects fuel consumption, driving dynamics and the tire lifespan. Hence, the state of tire pressure must be continuously sensed for comfort riding, optimal vehicle handling, and safety, and it is necessary for all types of transport. The existing detection methods are high cost and without any redundancy, if the sensor gets fails, which retard its wide application. The support vector machine (SVM) learning method is introduced for tire pressure loss detection. But, this method is not so accurate in detecting the normal and pressure loss judgement of tires. This research presents a novel approach for a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) to reduce the cost of sensor-based frames. The proposed model comes under three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction and tier pressure detection. Initially, an adaptive and unbiased Kalman filter (KF) with a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm (AUK-RLS) approach is introduced to eliminate manufacturing errors in speed gear. The second stage is the extraction of features. Statistical, frequency domain, and fitted frequency domain characteristics features are extracted from the wheel speed signal in this stage. It is fed to the deep learning (DL) model to perform the judgement of tier state. While using floating point model for the operation and storage process, the hardware cost of the DL model tends to be high. To tackle this issue, the convolutional neural network (CNN) hardware design will be optimized by combining both Integer/Floating-Point type inference engines. The design modules of the CNN interference engine are insisted of buffers, on-chip/off-chip memories, controllers, fine state machine (FSM), processing engine (PE) and routers. The PE module needs several adders and multiplier units, and this performs the convolution operation. Therefore, to diminish the area, delay and power consumption, the modified adder and multiplier design named Vedic multiplier based Carry select adder with simplified combinational logics (CSLA-SCL) is emphasized. The proposed system is implemented using Verilog code synthesis in the Xilinx ISE 14.5 simulator platform. The performance measure of pressure loss detection in terms of accuracy (99.25%) and errors are examined. Also, the performance measure of the detection model with the proposed adder and multiplier design is examined in terms of area utilization, power (145 mW), frequency (756 MHz) and delay (7.12 ns). © 2023},

	abstract = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a highly drought-resistant and cold-tolerant perennial energy crop, promising a favourable biomass energy source lately. For cost-effective switchgrass cultivation, physical characteristics and cost factors are critical in encouraging decision-makers to invest in this field. This study aims to develop a methodology to place cost analyses on a spatial basis and relate them with the environmental factors in the Eskisehir province, Türkiye. The results of a former study presenting the suitable lands for switchgrass cultivation in the region, in terms of physical parameters, were used to perform the spatial cost analysis based on the so-called indirect factors, fuel consumption, and crop yield. Regarding the assumed yield amounts and fuel consumption, the findings revealed that switchgrass agriculture on suitable lands would not promise a fixed profitability rate or fixed dry product sales price. Hence, different dry product sales prices were spatially determined and mapped according to five profitability ratios. The sales prices of the dry crop produced from high-suitable agricultural lands were found to be competitive (26.24 USD, 26.28 USD, and 26.31 USD) under free market conditions. Profitability rates varied between 22.79% and 22.66% with an optimistic scenario. It is predicted that 124,680 tons of bioethanol can be obtained with switchgrass production on lands where maximum benefit is provided. The method presented in this study demonstrates that a suitable site selection process can be conducted more holistically when cost-affecting parameters are integrated into spatial analyses and layering processes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The study showed that there are situations when the use of optical separation may result in a number of difficulties in removing a variable rate of good seeds from the raw mass, which can bring economic disadvantages. The identified issue encouraged the development of several flow assessment approaches in order to determine the problem’s essence and to develop the best strategy for action. The key finding was that the evaluated optical sorting equipment cannot eliminate impurities without also removing good seeds, resulting in every 1% increase in impurity level and a rate of 0.70% of the good seeds lost. Therefore, farmers must carefully consider the scenarios where integrating optical sorting into their technological flow is a suitable option, considering the input material quality, the selling price of the product, and the risk of missing an important quantity of high-quality seeds.

	abstract = {Precision forestry is a useful technique to help forest stakeholders with proper sustainable forest management. Modern sensors and technologies, with special reference to the sustainability of forest operations, can be applied on a variety of levels, including the monitoring of forest activities regarding the three pillars (economy, environment, and society). In this review, we summarised the current level of knowledge regarding the use of precision forestry techniques for monitoring forest operations. We concentrated on recent data from the last five years (2019–2023). We demonstrated how an Industry 4.0 strategy for remote and proximal monitoring of working performance can be effective when using CAN-bus and StanForD data collected by modern forest machines. The same information can be effectively used to create maps of soil trafficability and to evaluate the patterns of skid tracks or strip roads built as a result of forest intervention. Similar information can be gathered in the case of small-scale forestry by using GNSS-RF (Global Navigation Satellite Systems—Radio Frequency) or even monitoring systems based on smartwatches or smartphones. LiDAR and Structure for Motion (SfM) photogrammetry are both useful tools for tracking soil rutting and disturbances caused by the passage of forest machinery. SfM offers denser point clouds and a more approachable method, whereas laser scanning can be considerably faster but needs a more experienced operator and better data-processing skills. Finally, in terms of the social component of sustainability, the use of location sharing technologies is strongly advised, based for instance on GNSS—RF to monitor the security of forest workers as they operate. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Management level and user benefits have greatly contributed to agricultural machinery in recent years. The operational efficiency of agricultural machinery was commonly used to evaluate the utilization rate, operator driving ability, and management efficiency of agricultural machinery. However, the current operational efficiency of agricultural machinery cannot fully represent the overall operational efficiency of agricultural machinery. For example, although the low-power agricultural machinery has low operational efficiency, the generated benefits are not lower than that of high-power agricultural machinery, if the operating time is saturated. In addition, the quality of agricultural machinery operation can seriously affect operational efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the key influencing factors on the efficiency of agricultural machinery operations. In this study, a comprehensive and comprehensive evaluation was conducted on agricultural machinery operations. The operational efficiency was then evaluated on each agricultural machine using influencing factors. The daily operational information of each machine was taken as a piece of data on that day. The operation status of operators and agricultural machinery were checked to identify the influencing factors on the efficiency of operations, in order to improve the management level and revenue of agricultural machinery. The data was collected from the 32000 deep loosening operations of agricultural machinery. The results show that the main influencing factors on the daily operation efficiency of agricultural machinery were directly obtained, including the daily operation area, fuel consumption, operation quality, repeated operation rate, missed operation rate, and the proportion of effective operation time. The BP_Adaboost neural network (NN) training model was used to evaluate the efficiency of agricultural machinery operation. Manually grading was replaced to avoid the large workload and extremely low efficiency from the subjective factors, inconsistent standards, and labeling errors, due to the large number of agricultural machinery and the large amount of homework data. A comparison was made on the training model and manual grading to predict the remaining data. Manual scoring standards were effectively used to establish the predictive models. A small number of samples were selected to predict the operational efficiency of agricultural machinery. The low accuracy was obtained in the training model if there were too few labeled samples. If the additional labeled samples were added, manual grading was less labor-saving. Semi-supervised BP_Adaboost was utilized to evaluate the efficiency of agricultural machinery operations, where manually scoring some data was marked the daily efficiency. One part was used as training samples, whereas, another part was used as testing samples. The BP_Adaboost was then used to reduce the manual labeling of training samples for the high accuracy of the training model, where the remaining unrated data was predicted after training the model. 1 000 samples were selected from 32 000 deep loosening operation data for labeling, of which 500 were used as training samples and 500 were used as testing samples. The highest prediction accuracy was achieved in the semi-supervised method for the selected experimental data when the probability threshold was 97%. If the threshold was too large, there was only a limited increase in samples; If the sample was too small, misclassified samples led to low accuracy. Therefore, there was a significant impact on the sample selection and termination in semi-supervised methods. The prediction accuracies were achieved in 93.36% and 97.03%, respectively, using the BP_Adaboost, and semi-supervised BP_Adaboost with training samples. Statistical analysis was conducted on 32 000 agricultural machinery operation data from the experiment. The effectiveness of the improved model was obtained by combining the partial power agricultural machinery with different-width machines. The operation efficiency varied greatly in the power agricultural machinery when paired with different width machines. The optimal combination of agricultural machinery was recommended to enhance the operational capabilities, according to the operational efficiency. The accuracy of the improved model was higher than that of using the BP_Adaboost alone, depending largely on the selection of the probability threshold. The generalization and standards can be expected for the different datasets and the optimal thresholds. A more reasonable probability threshold can be selected to assign different weights to various indicators for the better performance of the improved model. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Carbon neutrality hinges on effectively harnessing renewable energy sources, a critical factor as countries worldwide enact low-carbon legislation to mitigate global warming. In this context, this study introduces an innovative soft-computing framework based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for predicting wave height and wave period, which are crucial parameters for energy harvesting. This model incorporates inputs such as temperature, wind speed, and wind direction to predict wave energy. The model was trained using data from the Lianyungang (LYG) and Dachen (DCN) stations in the East China Sea, and its performance was contrasted with that of artificial neural networks (ANNs) encompassing 10–50 neurons and utilizing subtractive clustering (SC) and grid partition (GP) techniques. The ANFIS SC method, with a 0.1 cluster radius (C.R), outperformed both the ANNs and ANFIS GP in wave energy prediction. The statistical analysis confirmed that this model yielded root-mean-squared error, R, and R 2 values of 0.0017, 0.987, and 0.974 for the LYG station and 0.0152, 0.93, and 0.867 for the DCN station. These metrics imply that the ANFIS SC algorithm excels in wave energy prediction, thus rendering it a potent instrument for wave-powered ship navigation. This study underscores the value of soft-computing techniques in pursuing renewable energy forecasting, contributing to sustainable and efficient marine transportation. © 2023, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

	abstract = {Conventional fuel consumption prediction (FCP) models using neural networks usually adopt driving parameters, such as speed and acceleration, as the training input, leading to a low prediction accuracy and a poor correlation between fuel consumption and driving behavior. To address this issue, the present study introduced jerk (an acceleration derivative) as an important variable in the training input of four selected neural networks: long short-term memory (LSTM), recurrent neural network (RNN), nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). Furthermore, the root-mean-square error (RMSE), relative error (RE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the prediction performance of each model. The results from the comparison experiment show that the LSTM model outperforms the other three models. Specifically, the four selected neural network models exhibited an improved accuracy in fuel consumption prediction after the jerk was added as a new variable to the training input. LSTM exhibited the greatest improvement under the high-speed expressway scenario, in which the RMSE decreased by 14.3%, the RE decreased by 28.3%, and the R2 increased by 9.7%. © 2023 by the authors.},

It is noted that the main task of the digital monitoring system is to analyze the effective operation of equipment. The proposed neural network can continuously receive data on the technical condition of agricultural machinery in real time, analyzes and structures input values, such as engine speed, hourly fuel consumption, coolant temperature, which depend on the load and operating modes of the machine engine. The advantage of the digital method of monitoring the parameters of the technical condition is its assessment in the process of diagnosing in real time. The method allows to determine not only the cause of engine failure, but also to evaluate the efficiency of complex energy-saturated agricultural machinery in general. The developed architecture of the neural network is capable of analyzing and transmitting data obtained during the diagnostic process to a special server for storing information. The proposed method for continuous monitoring of the technical condition of complex energy-saturated equipment according to controlled parameters, based on the use of neural networks, can be quickly adapted to different brands of equipment when diagnosing. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {Combine harvesters (CHs) use a high amount of diesel fuel. Their impact on greenhouse gases and air pollutants is significant. Reducing fuel consumption for agricultural machinery has immediate benefits, but new environmentally friendly techniques must be developed to achieve this. One aspect that could be considered to achieve this reduction could be the appropriate use of telematics data from the CHs in use. This article presents the dual approach method that includes a detailed analysis of telematics data and field trials to identify the potential sustainable use of CHs. This article shows field studies aimed at determining the exhaust gas composition and the effect of fuel consumption on global warming potential (GWP), when harvesting different cereals. It was determined that the feed rate to the CH and the engine load significantly impacted the share of GWP per ton of harvested crop. The results confirmed the benefits of maximum engine load (within the permissible limits of grain losses) in an economic and environmental context. During the tests, the maximum engine load ranged from 67.7 to 97.7%. Analysis of the telematics database of 215 CHs working in Lithuania and Latvia for 6 years showed that the average fuel consumption rate during harvesting, the total amount of fuel used and the impact on GWP were 56.7 ± 0.9 l h−1, 10 481.1 ± 396.2 l year−1, and 27 920.3 ± 1019.8 kg year−1, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In order to obtain the environmental conditions of livestock and poultry houses in a timely and reliable manner, and eliminate adverse environmental factors, scholars have been exploring various methods to obtain and predict environmental factors. This paper reviewed the literature from the last 10 years, specifically focusing on technologies for detecting environmental factors in livestock and poultry houses, which can be mainly divided into three categories: research on the environmental monitoring and control of livestock and poultry houses based on detection equipment and wireless sensor technology; research on the distribution and regularity of environmental factors in livestock and poultry houses based on a mathematical model; research on the environmental simulation and detection of livestock and poultry houses based on computer technology. The current testing methods have their advantages and disadvantages. When studying environmental factors, researchers should choose the most appropriate method for data acquisition according to the actual situation. The proposed recommendations for achieving this goal are as follows: (1) The control of environmental factors should be combined with the physiological response of livestock and poultry. The needs of animals should be considered; (2) Novel approaches need to be developed to integrate energy requirements into the environmental regulation of livestock and poultry houses; (3) It is necessary to research and develop control models and strategies that can predict the environment in the houses, and the transient simulation method should be further explored; (4) Improve environmental detection and control accuracy through the coupling of different technologies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the crucial issues for applying electret/triboelectric power generators in the Internet of Things (IoT) is to take full advantage of specific high voltage signals and enable self-powered sensing. Therefore, inspired by Miura-origami, we present an innovative origami power generator (OPG) constructed from only one piece of electret thin film. The Miura-origami architecture realizes a generator with excellent deformability and stretchability and makes it unnecessary for any auxiliary support structure during the compress-release cycle. Various parameters of the generator are intensively investigated, including the excitation accelerations, excitation displacements, numbers of power generation units and deformation degree of the device. When stimulated with 5.0 g acceleration at 15 Hz frequency, the generator with 8 generation units can obtain an instantaneous peak-to-peak voltage and a remarkable optimum peak power of 328 V and 2152 μW at 50 MΩ, respectively. In addition, the regulable shape and multiple generation modes of the device greatly improve its applicability in various vibration energy collection requirements. Based on the above results, a hexagonal electret generator integrated with six-phase OPGs is developed as a “Buoy on Sky,” after which the signal waveforms generated from internal power generators are recognized with 92% accuracy through a neural network algorithm that identifies the vibration conditions of transmission lines. This work demonstrates that a fusion of origami art and energy conversion techniques can achieve a multifunctional generator design satisfying the requirements for IoT applications.

	abstract = {Localization is critical for automated vehicles as it provides essential position, velocity, and heading angle information to perform object tracking, trajectory prediction, motion planning, and control. However, model/environmental uncertainties (including road friction) and noises in sensor measurements have a significant effect on the accuracy of the localization and vehicle state estimation, specially for perceptually degraded conditions. In this article, an integrated localization method based on the fusion of an inertial dead reckoning model and 3D LiDAR-based map matching is proposed and experimentally verified in an urban environment with varying environmental conditions. Leveraging a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial navigation system (INS), and 3D LiDAR point clouds, a novel light point cloud map generation method, which only keeps the necessary point clouds (i.e., buildings and roads regardless of vegetation varying with seasonal change), is proposed. Subsequently, based on the onboard sensors and the pre-built light point cloud map, a dead reckoning model is derived and integrated with the normal distribution transformation (NDT) based map matching algorithm by an error-state-constrained Kalman filter to limit the localization error. On top of the Kalman filter, the stability analysis of the estimator is presented. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is validated in real road experiments under various environmental conditions. Thorough experiments in winter and summer and associated results confirm the advantages of integrating the proposed light point cloud map generation with the dead reckoning model in terms of accuracy and reduced computational complexity.  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Innovation has been the transforming tool of precision agriculture as a response to population growth and the demand for more food with quality, less waste, food security, and sustainable management of environmental resources. The challenges are to increase the productivity of cultivated areas, both for current and future areas, to manage the use of potable water, scarce in many regions, to keep the soil fertile, and to reduce waste through reuse, optimization, resource sharing, and operational and strategic management based on accurate information of planting, harvesting, and management of environmental conditions, which are also objectives of the Circular Economy. Therefore, using Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture becomes fundamental to facing such challenges. This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies adopted in agriculture for sustainable development, considering environmental, economic, and social benefits. The research pointed to the use of IoT in irrigation control systems by sending automatic commands, monitoring soil and weather conditions, in the use of machinery with some automation features and in cloud data storage systems, and with the use of Big Data analytical tools, with access by mobile devices, these uses contribute to operational and strategic decision making in the management of planting and harvesting. However, the literature review did not find a technological architecture for Integrated Services in Agriculture 4.0. Thus, this paper proposes a Service Architecture that enables the promotion of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The contribution of this article to the theory is in the expansion of knowledge of the use of technologies in Agriculture 4.0. In terms of practice, this article provides an Integrated Service Architecture so that new products can be developed for Agriculture 4.0 and thus contribute to society in reducing food insecurity, generating environmental, economic, and social benefits, and promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing global population, the supply of nonrenewable resources such as fossil fuels are limited. Therefore, it is urgent to implement measures to control and reduce energy consumption in agriculture and other sectors. Improving energy efficiency and reducing pollution in agriculture can bring both financial and environmental benefits. By optimizing in-field coverage planning of agricultural vehicles, fuel consumption can be reduced. Recent developments in automated coverage planning algorithms, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional, aim to optimize and automate operations. The elevation property of agricultural fields has a significant impact on coverage path planning, which means that 3D coverage path planning can be highly advantageous for field operations. In this study, a 3D coverage path planning model was developed that effectively determines the optimal driving direction in a field based on energy consumption criteria. A digital elevation model (DEM) was utilized to construct an analytical model that provides improved characterization of the topographical features of three-dimensional landscapes. The aims of this paper encompass the formulation and execution of a 3D coverage planning strategy for material input operations that aims to reduce energy consumption, reduce overall traveled distance, generate a map to display variable application rates for fertilizers using remote sensing techniques, and the evaluation of soil compaction risks in an agricultural field. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization model. In the first sample field, the model was able to generate a solution that reduced the required energy by up to 9.5%, while in the second sample field, it achieved a reduction of up to 15.6% in required energy. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering multiple objectives in coverage path planning and demonstrates how our proposed optimization model can contribute to significant energy savings and reduced environmental impact in agricultural fields. © 2024 The Authors},

Numerous building characteristics are found to correlate with heating load. Building height, wall area, surface area, roof area, and so forth are some examples of these. With an R-squared score of 0.921, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.87, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.14, the models created for this study show high accuracy. With an astounding accuracy rate of 99.2%, the decision tree model excels among the tested algorithms. The exceptional performance of this model highlights its potential for useful applications in heating load prediction. Promising outcomes are also shown by other algorithms, such as logistic regression at 94.14%, K-nearest neighbors at 95.6%, and neural networks at 96.24%. The results of this study demonstrate how machine learning can be used to predict heating load, offering important information for the creation of energy-saving measures.

	abstract = {This article presents a fully autonomous system-on-chip (SoC) that can be distributed along a fiber strand, capable of simultaneously harvesting energy, cooperatively scaling performance, sharing power, and booting-up with other in-fiber SoCs for ultra-low-power (ULP) sensing applications. Utilizing a custom switched capacitor energy harvesting and power management unit (EHPMU), the SoC can efficiently redistribute and reuse harvested energy along the fiber. Integrated on-chip, the ULP RISC-V digital core and temperature sensor enable energy-efficient sensing and computation at nanowatt power levels. A dedicated ripple boot-up and cooperative dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) further optimize the operation and physical size of the system. Fabricated in 65 nm, measurement results show that the proposed SoC achieves 33 nW power consumption for the whole chip under 92 Lux lighting condition and can reduce control power down to 2.7 nW for the EHPMU. With the proposed power sharing and cooperative DVFS techniques, the SoC reduces the illuminance needed to stay alive by >7× down to 12 Lux. Integrated into a mm-scale polymer fiber, our SoC demonstrates the feasibility of fully autonomous and ULP on-body sensing systems in resource-constrained fiber environments. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The reduction of the population and labour force in rural areas, adverse climate changes, soil pollution and degradation, and reduced soil fertility necessitate new and intensive approaches to and methods of vegetable production. In this study, a new high-tech, small-scale hydroponic system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for growing leafy vegetables was designed. For the assembly of the high-tech small-scale hydroponic system, low-cost materials and sensors are used, allowing remote monitoring and process automation during the cultivation of leafy vegetables and seedlings. Experimental investigations of the installation were conducted, with lettuce as the grown crop. The environmental and technological parameters of the system were monitored and analysed in order to assess the suitability of the system. The obtained results confirm that the small-scale hydroponic system maintained the set parameters of air temperature, air humidity and pH of the nutrient solution within the optimal limits for growing lettuce. Other parameters, such as temperature and electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution, had small deviations from the required optimal limits. In the initially set experiment, 75% germination of the lettuce seeds was achieved. The main advantages of the proposed hydroponic system are the simplicity of its management and easy installation. Furthermore, it offers the possibility for remote monitoring and control without any high requirements towards the experience of the user with such facilities. The designed and implemented small hydroponic system can help small and medium-sized vegetable growers achieve indoor sustainable farming of leafy vegetables year-round. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The field of transportation plays a crucial role in the development of society. It is vital to establish a smart transportation system to increase the convenience and security of human life. The incorporation of artificial intelligence and the internet of things into the traffic system has facilitated the emergence of innovative technologies like autonomous vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles, which contribute to the reduction of traffic accidents and the liberation of human driving time. However, this improvement involves the use of multiple sensor devices that need external power sources. As a result, pollution occurs, as do increases in manufacturing costs. Therefore, the quest to develop sustainable energy remains a formidable obstacle. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a possible solution for addressing this problem owing to their exceptional performance and simple design. This article explores the use of TENG-based self-power sensors and their potential applications in the field of transportation.

To be suitable for both facility- and field-based production scenarios, we incorporated two types of plant protection devices, utilizing ozone sterilization and light-trap technologies. The devices were equipped with various sensors to realize real-time collection and monitoring of data on the crop production environment. The information management system has an IoT-based architecture and includes a mobile device app to enable remote control of the plant protection devices for intelligent management of plant protection data. The system can achieve efficient management of large-scale equipment applications and multi-device collaborative work to prevent and control pests and diseases. The developed system has operated successfully for several years in China and has been applied to cucumber, tomato, rice, and other crops.

	abstract = {As artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been shown to be precise and reliable in supporting the field of artificial intelligence technology, agricultural scientists have focused on employing ANN for agricultural applications. The ANN can be an effective alternative for evaluating agricultural operations. The intended aim of this investigation was to employ both ANN and multiple linear regression (MLR) to develop a model for determining the rear wheel slip of an agricultural tractor in two-wheel drive (2WD) mode during plowing operations. The output parameter of the models was tractor rear wheel slip. The training data were collected from filed experiments using chisel, moldboard, and disk plows. The plows were operated under different conditions of soil texture, plowing depth, soil moisture content, and plowing speed. All data were acquired during field experiments in two soil textures (clay and clay loam textures). The training dataset was comprised of 319 data points, while 65 data points were employed to test both ANN and MLR models estimation capability. The ANN model with a backpropagation training algorithm was created using the commercial Qnet2000 software by changing its topology and related parameters. The best ANN model possessed a topology of 7-20-1. The estimated tractor rear wheel slip using the testing dataset displayed strong agreement with measured tractor rear wheel slip with the coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9977. The results definitely illustrated that the ANN model was capable of defining the correlation between the inputs and rear wheel slip. The outcomes suggest that the established ANN model is trustworthy in predicting the tractor rear wheel slip for an agricultural tractor in 2WD mode during the tillage process compared to MLR models. This study provides a useful tool for management of tillage implements during field operations. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a novel up-and-coming technology with wide applicability and great potential to be used in agricultural systems for spraying applications. However, the cost-effectiveness of this application is still rather uncertain. The present study utilized actual data from field applications to analyze the critical components and parameters in the potential case of using UAV sprayers for the control of olive fruit flies in order to assess the operational costs. The results are compared with the costs of two traditional spraying methods: manual spaying by workers using backpack sprayers and manual spraying assisted by a tractor. The case of the olive fruit fly was selected because it involves costly, time consuming, and laborious manual spraying. Furthermore, the bait character of spraying in these applications does not require full canopy coverage, making it ideal for UAV applications. A parameterized computational model was developed to assess the costs of labor, capital spending, repair and maintenance, energy, licensees, fees and taxes, and storage for each of the three methods. In addition, the cost for surveillance was also accounted for with the UAV method. Consequently, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of the most crucial parameters. The results showed that the cost of spraying with a UAV was 1.45 to 2 times higher than the traditional methods, mainly due to the high capital spending resulting from a low economic life. There are opportunities, however, of improving the economic performance, making it compatible to the traditional methods, by using a smaller UAV with longer lasting batteries and by expanding its annual use beyond the needs of olive fruit fly control. © 2023 by the authors.},

A new class of digital pump technology has been developed to overcome these limitations. This work builds upon a previously developed high-efficiency digital pump that utilizes high-speed on/off valves. There are four distinct strategies in which the digital pump technology can operate, and each of these strategies offers unique advantages that make it suitable for specific operating conditions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes expert systems technology in combination with several automated machine-learning methodologies to determine the most efficient operating strategy. Different supervised machine-learning algorithms are investigated to predict the overall efficiency of each operating strategy. The best machine-learning model is then employed for selecting the most efficient operating strategy given any operating condition. Given the findings, the efficiencies predicted by the machine-learning model align well with the efficiencies measured through experiments. This innovative approach has resulted in substantial energy savings compared to the currently available pumps in the market. © 2023},

	abstract = {The pitch angle of greenhouse tractors changes when operating on rough soil pavement. As a result, the feedback signal lags behind the tractor motion attitude signal, thereby affecting the real-time control of tilling depth. In this study, a pitch angle prediction model of greenhouse electric tractor was proposed based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) and time series analysis to improve the dynamic response speed of tilling depth regulation by providing predictive information for advance control. EKF was used to track the tilling depth of greenhouse electric tractor in real time, and an auto-regressive moving average model (ARMA) was established for the obtained time series data. ARMA (2, 1) was designed as the pitch angle prediction model of greenhouse electric tractors by constructing a simulation model. Inertia measurement unit (IMU) of tractor was used to construct the extended Kalman estimation model of the pitch angle. Actual vehicle tests were carried out under different working conditions. Results show that the estimated values obtained under two operating conditions have a high correlation with the measured values, with correlation coefficients(R) of 0.9504 and 0.9734, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.2355 and 0.2173, and maximum absolute error (MAE) of 0.1929 and 0.1703, respectively. And,the MAE and the RMSE of the predicted and measured values of ARMA (2,1) model approximately have the same value under the two conditions, with with the R of 0.9665 and 0.9755, the RMSE of 0.2002 and 0.1812, and the MAE of 0.1578 and 0.1387, respectively. The effectiveness of ARMA (2, 1) as the pitch angle estimation and prediction model of greenhouse electric tractors is verified.

	abstract = {The coordination of urbanization with the ecological environment has become a significant sustainable urban development problem given the current acceleration in China’s urbanization. The existing research lacks in-depth discussion on the coordination relationship between urbanization and energy eco-environment from the perspective of urban agglomeration. This paper takes the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration as its research area. The combination of CRITIC and entropy weight methods is used to measure the comprehensive urbanization level (CUL) from the four dimensions of population, economy, land, and society, and the SBM-Undesirable model is used to measure the energy eco-efficiency (EE). The spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic evolution law of the coupling coordination degree (CCD) between CUL and EE are analyzed using the coupling coordination model and the spatial Markov chain. The research results reveal that (1) from the comprehensive development level standpoint, both CUL and EE are on the rise from 2010 to 2021; however, a problem of unbalanced development is observed. (2) The overall CCD displays an upward trend and evinces significant spatial differentiation characteristics from the coordinated development level viewpoint. (3) The CCD transition state is not isolated to certain geographic spaces: adjacent cities will impact changes in the coupling coordination types of an urban center. Therefore, we propose strategies to improve the CCD between CUL and EE to offer theoretical and policy inferences for the formulation of sustainable urban development strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

As much as practically possible research sub-divisions of the field are also identified. It is highlighted that research topics dealing with ocean renewable energy, control and path tracking of ships, as well as computational modelling of wave-induced motions are growing. Updating and forecasting energy resources, developing computational methods for wave generation, and introducing novel methods for the optimised control of energy converters are highlighted as the potential research opportunities. Ongoing studies follow the global needs for environmentally friendly renewable energies, though engineering-based studies often tend to overlook the longer-term potential influence of climate change. Development and exploitation of computational engineering methods with focus on continuum mechanics problems remain relevant.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has constantly entered various applications in economical ways, specifically in control and monitoring applications in the sector related to agriculture. Moreover, the process of attaining neutrality in the energy for the Internet of Things (IoT) remains a challenging task. The agricultural sector is still affected by various pest diseases, which lead to danger to the productivity of crops and economically affect the farmers. To overcome these challenges, this research introduced an energy harvesting system to achieve the state of energy neutrality in IoT-based smart agricultural systems. Moreover, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is utilized to attain the state of energy neutrality, and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to detect the pests for the provided Region of Interest (ROI). The Xception model is utilized to classify the codling moths and general insects affecting the crops. The Raspberry Pi3 (RPi3) is utilized to collect images in a single board computer and helps detect the pests accurately. The hybrid energy harvesting system is a combination of solar, wind and grid harvesters. Li-Po battery with 1820 mAh is utilized to charge the Hybrid system using the Xception model. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid energy harvesting system consumed minimum energy of 118.2 J while the existing methods, such as Smart Energy Harvesting using Wireless Sensor Networks (SEH-WSN) and Long Range – Low Power Wide Area Networks (LR-LPWAN), consumed energy of 129.8 J and 124.5 J respectively. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®},

	abstract = {Field-road classification is a key task in processing spatio-temporal trajectories in the agricultural field. This task involves classifying agricultural machinery trajectories into field operation and road driving trajectories. Accurately classifying these trajectories is essential for precision agriculture. However, the existing methods for field-road classification do not address the issue of data imbalance between the numbers of field and road points in trajectories. To improve the accuracy of field-road classification and solve the data imbalance problem in agricultural machinery trajectories, a generative adversarial network-bidirectional long short-term memory network (GAN-BiLSTM) field-road classification model is proposed in this paper. First, we use a GAN for data augmentation to obtain a balanced dataset. Second, we propose a BiLSTM with attention mechanism (Att-BiLSTM) to capture data features. Finally, we train the model using focal loss to further learn points that are difficult to classify for field-road classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conducted experiments and compared our results with those of the current field-road classification methods on 160 agricultural trajectory samples. Our model achieved 92.3% accuracy and a 92.1% F1 score, exhibiting improvements of 5.9% in accuracy and 6.4% in F1 score compared with the current state-of-the-art method.

	abstract = {Increasing the yield of oilseeds is considered an important plan and strategy in different countries such as Iran. With limited available arable land, boosting the cultivation of oilseeds should involve increasing per unit area. Therefore, narrowing the yield gap (YG) and optimizing agricultural practices/inputs can be the efficient strategies for improving food security and mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture. For this purpose, the boundary line analysis (BLA) was integrated with the life cycle assessment (LCA) in this study to survey 301 soybean farms. BLA analysis calculated attainable yield and YG as 4437 and 1972 kg ha−1, respectively. According to the results, the BLA improved the efficient use of resources and attenuated environmental hazards by exploring the causes of YG and optimizing farm practices, something which was confirmed by the LCA and the ReCiPe2016 model. For instance, optimization of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur fertilizers resulted in reduction rates of 44%, 45%, 87%, and 56% the in global warming potential, respectively. As a result of the BLA-optimized tillage operations, the impacts of mineral resource scarcity and freshwater eutrophication were reduced by 15% and 16%, respectively. In addition, a reduction rate of 52% was also observed in the water use impact category due to the optimal irrigation frequencies, i.e., 1–3 times. Moreover, diesel fuel and fertilizers are the primary sources of environmental damage. Eventually, tillage optimization and fertilization should be first taken into account in order to produce larger amounts of healthier food by bridging the YG.

	abstract = {Data processing of low-altitude remote sensing visible images from UAVs is one of the hot research topics in precision agriculture aviation. In order to solve the problems of large model size with slow detection speed that lead to the inability to process images in real time, this paper proposes a lightweight target detector CURI-YOLOv7 based on YOLOv7tiny which is suitable for individual citrus tree detection from UAV remote sensing imagery. This paper augmented the dataset with morphological changes and Mosica with Mixup. A backbone based on depthwise separable convolution and the MobileOne-block module was designed to replace the backbone of YOLOv7tiny. SPPF (spatial pyramid pooling fast) was used to replace the original spatial pyramid pooling structure. Additionally, we redesigned the neck by adding GSConv and depth-separable convolution and deleted its input layer from the backbone with a size of (80, 80) and its output layer from the head with a size of (80, 80). A new ELAN structure was designed, and the redundant convolutional layers were deleted. The experimental results show that the GFLOPs = 1.976, the parameters = 1.018 M, the weights = 3.98 MB, and the mAP = 90.34% for CURI-YOLOv7 in the UAV remote sensing imagery of the citrus trees dataset. The detection speed of a single image is 128.83 on computer and 27.01 on embedded devices. Therefore, the CURI-YOLOv7 model can basically achieve the function of individual tree detection in UAV remote sensing imagery on embedded devices. This forms a foundation for the subsequent UAV real-time identification of the citrus tree with its geographic coordinates positioning, which is conducive to the study of precise agricultural management of citrus orchards. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to become a driving force in the evolution of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, autonomous continuous monitoring and control platforms, and low-power consumption devices. Conventionally, these devices are battery-operated. The battery lifespan degrades faster in the case of continuous monitoring devices. Limited battery lifetime motivates us to investigate an eco-friendly solution to solve the issue of limited battery life and frequent replacement. Energy harvesting (EH) is a key-enabling technique that provides a viable solution to the challenge at hand. EH minimizes battery dependence by collecting energy from ambient sources. Although several studies have been conducted on EH-IoT networks, a tutorial on a possible mapping between the use cases/application to the IoT devices and the IoT devices to EH power source still needs to be included. To address this gap, we classify IoT devices based on their applications. Based on the different interfacing sections of layer architecture design of IoT device, this paper tries to fill the gap between IoT applications and the self-sustainable IoT system design. Next, each interfacing section is categorized into layer architecture of IoT device to study layer-specific power requirements (or demand) versus EH sources (or supply). We have considered various applications like agriculture, healthcare, industry, city, security, transportation, and water management. Further, we discuss different energy sources to harness ambient energy and the method to store the harvested energy. Then, the widely used standards and the various steps taken for the interoperability and compatibility of EH-IoT are outlined to understand the elements of the EH interface. Finally, we point out future research issues requiring specific attention for deploying self-sustainable IoT-based delay-limited applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The specific properties of BF-WSNs have brought new challenges in fundamental issues, such as energy management, networking, and data acquisition, which means the existing algorithms in WSNs cannot be adopted directly. The BF-WSN can be regarded as a totally new topic in Internet of Things (IoT) and has attracted much attention from researchers. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve the fundamental problems in BF-WSNs. The objective of this survey is to comprehensively summarize and analyze the existing works.

	abstract = {The emergence of various underwater wireless communication systems has been on the rise due to increasing human activities in the marine environment. In underwater wireless communication networks (UWCNs), several communication devices, such as sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) are interconnected to expand communication coverage, monitoring, information gathering, and surveillance. These devices operate on batteries, making their replacement and recharging difficult. Consequently, sustaining the operational lifetime of UWCNs is deemed a major challenge. This leads to the development of various energy harvesting (EH) techniques to perpetuate the power supply to underwater devices. In this paper, we present a review of various energy sources and EH techniques applicable to UWCNs. To achieve this, we classify the energy sources into various categories in order to establish the peculiarities of each source and the type of harvester applicable to each category. Based on this classification, we present discussions on various contributions of articles related to applications of EH techniques in UWCNs. In addition to various insights gained from the presented papers, we establish that energy harvesters based on triboelectric effect, piezoelectric effect, sediment microbial fuel cell, acoustic, and optical power transfer are suitable for low-power (milliwatt-order) consuming devices such as sensors. Also, for devices with high power consumption requirement, such as AUV, solar and inductive power transfer-based harvesters should be employed. Furthermore, we identify several technical challenges that should be taken into consideration during the planning and system design phases. Finally, we highlight open research areas that could further improve the EH and communication processes in UWCNs. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are characterized by high flexibility and low deployment costs. Therefore, UAVs, in recent years, have been widely used in all walks of life, such as logistics services, search and rescue, agriculture and mining. These applications are highly dependent on UAV communication technology. However, the UAVs currently in use are still powered by low-power batteries, which greatly limits the operational life of UAVs, resulting in varying degrees of communication interruptions and cost increases. Therefore, improving the energy efficiency (EE) of UAV communication has become a key problem that needs to be urgently solved. This article gives a comprehensive review of methods to improve the EE of UAVs through UAV trajectory planning and deployment, resource allocation and management, energy saving communication protocol design and UAV energy harvesting (EH) and transfer. Additionally, this paper engages with related research to put forward some promising research directions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Roadside data collecting and communication applications might all benefit from power produced by energy harvesting from highways. According to the energy source they tap, roadside energy harvesters may be roughly divided into three categories: solar radiation, pavement heat, and mechanical energy from moving automobiles. In addition to environmental issues like the heat island impact on cities, asphalt pavements exposed to sun radiation may reach high temperatures that result in structural damage from hardening or rutting resulting from heat cycles. Asphalt solar collectors (ASCs) are one of the types of active systems that are doubly effective since they alleviate the difficulties that were described before and. Furthermore, ASCs can capture energy that can be utilized in a variety of different applications. To provide a complete picture of recent scientific developments, this review covers numerical, experimental, and numerical and experimental research on ASCs. Specifically, the setup, design parameters, advancement, challenges, and mathematical modeling of ASCs are systematically discussed. Accordingly, a number of suggestions for further research projects have been made in light of the associated results. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {The increasing importance of utilizing new technologies, such as GNSS (Global navigation satellite system) devices, total stations, drones, scanners, etc., in forestry has become evident with the development of these tools. Combined with precise GNSS devices, UAVs represent an efficient tool that facilitates field measurements and reduces time spent in the field while also providing highly accurate data. To accurately determine the application of spatial data for calculating the longitudinal slope of forest/logging roads in a research project, measurements based on UAVs were conducted and compared with GNSS data. GNSS data were considered the reference values for the studied area, assuming that satellite positions and internet signals were good. An accurate longitudinal slope was necessary to define fuel consumption on forest/logging roads and slopes throughout the project and to verify the calculation method that could be applied for such or similar terrain conditions and overgrowth. The main goal of this research phase was not to study fuel consumption but to obtain an accurate longitudinal profile of forest/skid roads on rocky terrain that is not overgrown or poorly grown. The study put forth two hypotheses, one of which was ultimately confirmed, while the other was refuted. The results show no significant differences when comparing the absolute elevation of the points in the profiles for defining the longitudinal slope of the road using the program for designing forest/skid roads. While applying such a method of data collection to create the main projects for the (re)construction of forest/skid roads, there are significant deviations in earthwork masses. There was a difference of over 22.64% in one of the types of earthwork excavation on the designed forest road, so the method implemented in the research does not give sufficiently accurate results. © 2023 by the authors.},

The yield of grain crops constitutes a critical metric for optimizing agricultural planning. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the efficacy of integrating common programming principles with the employment of mineral fertilizers and enhanced plant protection to augment the yield of grain crops under the prevailing natural conditions of the Zhetysu region in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The methodological framework of this study is grounded in the application of practical, applied research methods to assess the potential of yield programming for wheat and barley. This assessment is contingent upon the utilization of fertilizers and plant protection products within the specific agro-climatic context of southeastern Kazakhstan. It was observed that the treatment of seeds with protective-stimulating agents significantly improves the health and viability of cereal crops. These benefits are evidenced by the suppression of infections and enhancements in germination rates and pest resistance. Field experiments conducted within the Zhetysu region indicate that the sowing of pre-treated seeds in late April is conducive to optimal plant development and yield. The findings suggest that further research should concentrate on refining the application of fertilizers and protective agents to enhance predictive models and yield outcomes at a national scale. ©2023 IIETA.},

	abstract = {Seedbed preparation constitutes a highly important step in the crop establishment process since it directly influences both quality and yield expectation in crop fields. The quality of seedbed preparation is usually assessed by the operator of the tractor or a supervising farmer and thus dependent on qualified field personnel which are scarce today. Subsequent to the visual assessment of the current seedbed structure, a qualified operator can manually adapt the secondary tillage machine in order to optimize resource efficiency (e.g., fuel consumption) while maintaining optimal seedbed preparation according to local soil conditions. In this work, we propose to use an automated approach for real-time in-situ measurement of seedbed quality. Stereo cameras mounted in the front and the back of the tractor provide images and depth-information. Additionally, telemetry data such as working speed, power take-off (PTO) speed, fuel consumption and engine torque utilization of the tractor are logged. Based on this data, we develop a Deep-Learning-based model to predict seedbed quality (measured in form of the Roughness Coefficient), engine torque utilization and engine fuel rate. Thus, we model the interaction of the soil and the machine (soil-machine response) when preparing the seedbed with different machine configurations and environment states. For training and evaluating our model, we collected data from 16 field runs with varying soil types ranging from loamy sand to silty clay in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Based on this data, we demonstrate that our novel model is able to predict the soil-machine response on previously unseen fields with high accuracy – in our setting with a relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) between 12.2 and 14.4 %. Our proposed model has two main advantages: (1) it allows farmers to plan the optimal machine configuration in advance by simulating different machine configurations and thus reduce the complexity for the operator and (2) it can serve as a basis for the training of intelligent control agents. © 2023},

	abstract = {In this research article, the objective is to determine the return on investment (ROI) of photovoltaic (PV) power plants by employing machine learning (ML) techniques. Special focus is done on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as a pivotal economic parameter crucial for facilitating economic decision-making and enabling quantitative comparisons among different energy generation technologies. Traditional methods of calculating LCOE often rely on fixed singular input values, which may fall short in addressing uncertainties associated with assessing the financial feasibility of PV projects. In response, a dynamic model that integrates essential demographic, energy, and policy data, is introduced encompassing factors such as interest rates, inflation rates, and energy yield, which are anticipated to undergo changes over the lifetime of a PV system. This dynamic model provides a more accurate estimation of LCOE. The comparative analysis of ML algorithms indicates that the auto-regression integration moving average (ARIMA) model exhibits a high accuracy of 93.8% in predicting consumer electricity prices. The validation of the model is highlighted through two case studies in the United States and the Philippines underscores the potential impact on LCOE values. For instance, in California, LCOE values could vary by nearly 30% (5.03 cents kWh−1 for singular values vs 7.09 cents kWh−1 using our ML model), influencing the perceived risk or economic feasibility of a PV power plant. Additionally, the ML model estimates the ROI for a grid-connected PV plant in the Philippines at 5.37 years, in contrast to 4.23 years using traditional methods. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) serve as the backbone for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities, enabling the gathering of essential data and vital information. The widespread deployment of sensors created new scenarios that presented new domains for various applications. Due to their numerous advantages, WSN's simulators are still gaining considerable attention as the primary method for testing and evaluating new protocols and approaches for WSN. The scientific community has developed various simulators, some tailored explicitly for WSNs and others for general use. In addition, an old but renovated direction has been enormously grown recently, representing the researcher's attention to building its own simulator. However, many researchers struggle to select the most appropriate tool for performance analysis, which requires extensive research into available options. Choosing a suitable simulator to meet the necessary simulation criteria necessitates exhaustive research into the available options. The published studies on WSN's simulators have limitations, such as the limited number of simulators under examination, ignoring the essential functions of the simulators, and inadequate performance criteria for precise comparison. To get beyond these restrictions in previous studies and offer a fresh study that compares the simulation tools comprehensively, an analysis of thirty-three different simulators was conducted based on a new taxonomy. Furthermore, this study examines the advantages and constraints of each simulator regarding many specific academic areas in WSNs. Moreover, the study presented a detailed comparison among the performance analysis tools according to many famous performance metrics.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Initiatives to minimise battery use, address sustainability, and reduce regular maintenance have driven the challenge to use alternative power sources to supply energy to devices deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. As a key pillar of fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G networks,IoT is estimated to reach 42 billion devices by the year 2025. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are solid state energy harvesters which reliably and renewably convert thermal energy into electrical energy. These devices are able to recover lost thermal energy, produce energy in extreme environments, generate electric power in remote areas, and power micro-sensors. Applying the state of the art, the authorspresent a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) approaches applied in combination with TEG-powered IoT devices to manage and predict available energy. The application areas of TEG-driven IoT devices that exploit as a heat source the temperature differences found in the environment, biological structures, machines, and other technologies are summarised. Based on detailed research of the state of the art in TEG-powered devices, the authors investigated the research challenges, applied algorithms and application areas of this technology. The aims of the research were to devise new energy prediction and energy management systems based on ML methods, create supervised algorithms which better estimate incoming energy, and develop unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches which provide adaptive and dynamic operation. The review results indicate that TEGs are a suitable energy harvesting technology for low-power applications through their scalability, usability in ubiquitous temperature difference scenarios, and long operating lifetime. However, TEGs also have low energy efficiency (around 10%) and require a relatively constant heat source. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) generates unlimited data, which should be collected and forwarded towards a central controller (CC) for further processing and decision-making. Nevertheless, the unique features of IoT devices, such as their limited energy capacity, large-scale deployment, and prospective mobility, introduce new challenges and constraints, resulting in unoptimized data gathering. Therefore, as a forthcoming solution, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be dispatched as auxiliary devices, and the benefits of their potential are fully exploited, such as movement flexibility, mitigation of IoT communication burden, minimization of data collection (DC) delay, powering IoT devices, and efficient delivery of collected data. The current state-of-the-art has a noticeable gap that hinders the systematic reviews of UAV-based DC schemes. To bridge this gap, this survey provides an extensive analysis of UAV-based DC schemes to light up the topic. We first outline the main characteristics of UAV networks, which have to be considered when designing an efficient UAV-based DC scheme. Also, we highlight the main challenges that, if considered during the data gathering process, can significantly enhance the assistance of UAVs to IoT devices. We then describe various UAV-based DC applications with their key features. Next, our paper comprehensively discusses UAV-based DC schemes according to a proposed taxonomy. Finally, we discuss current problems, difficulties, and potential future directions for UAV-based DC research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Radio-frequency wireless energy transfer (WET) is a promising technology to realize wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs) and enable sustainable underground monitoring. However, due to the severe attenuation in harsh underground soil and the tight energy budget of the underground sensors, traditional WPUSNs relying on the channel state information (CSI) are highly inefficient, especially in massive WET scenarios. To address this challenge, we comparatively assess the feasibility of several state-of-the-art CSI-free multiantenna WET schemes for WPUSNs, under a given power budget. Moreover, to overcome the extremely low WET efficiency in underground channels, we propose a distributed CSI-free system, where multiple power beacons (PBs) simultaneously charge a large set of underground sensors without any CSI. We consider the position-aware K -Means and the position-agnostic equally far-from-center (EFFC) approaches for the optimal deployment of the PBs. Our results evince that the performance of the proposed distributed CSI-free system can approach or even surpass that of a traditional full-CSI WET strategy, especially when adopting an appropriate CSI-free scheme, applying the advisable PBs deployment approach, and equipping the PBs with an appropriate number of antennas. Finally, we discuss the impact of underground parameters, i.e., the burial depth of devices and the volumetric water content of soil, on the system's performance, and identify potential challenges and research opportunities for practical distributed CSI-free WPUSNs deployment. © 2014 IEEE.},

The methodology involves geolocation and georeferencing of the study area, trajectory planning, extracting altitude characteristics from the map to create an altitude profile, collecting terrain features, and ultimately calculating IPC. The most accurate estimation was achieved on clay terrain with a 5.43% error compared to measures. For pavement and gravel terrains, 19.19% and 102.02% errors were obtained, respectively. This methodology provides IPC estimation on three different terrains using satellite information, which is corroborated with field experiments.

	abstract = {Modelling and optimizing soil-tool interaction parameters for tillage operations is crucial for developing efficient and precise tools. This study focused on a specific draft of sweep tools in the soil bin filled with vertisol, considering factors such as tool geometry, cone index, working depth and operational speed. Data analysis showed that the range of specific draft values, from 9.51 to 38.95 kN/m2. Machine learning models, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), bagged trees (BT) and boosted trees (BoT), were developed using experimental data to predict the specific draft of sweep tools with hyperparameter configuration. The developed machine learning models have also been compared with the predictive multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and it was found that the predictive performance of the machine learning models was better than the MLR model during training and testing. The fine-tuned ANN model achieved impressive statistical performance with the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.489 kN/m2, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.619 kN/m2, standard error of prediction (SEP) of 3.462% and highest coefficient of determination (R2) of.99 during testing. R2 values for BT, BoT, SVM and MLR models were.97,.96,.94 and.83, respectively, for specific draft predictions. The findings from this study have practical implications for optimizing sweep tool design and improving tillage operation.

	abstract = {Soil compaction resulting from heavy machinery use in agricultural and forestry operations poses a significant threat to sustainable agriculture. Advancements in remote sensing technology have enabled the acquisition of vegetation, water, and soil spectral indices, which offer valuable insights into soil properties. This study focuses on estimating the pre-compression stress (Pc) by developing pedotransfer functions (PTFs) using Sentinel-2 satellite-derived spectral indices and soil properties (clay, CaCo3, and bulk density) as inputs. Two machine learning methods, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), are employed for the estimation. A total of 140 surface soil samples were collected randomly from agricultural areas in Qazvin province, Iran. The results indicate that the BRT method outperforms the RF method in terms of accuracy. The estimation of Pc achieved better results when the Redness Index (RI) was used as the soil spectral index and the Surface Water Capacity Index (SWCI) was employed as the water spectral index, along with the soil properties as inputs for PTF3 and PTF11. In the training and testing steps, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 0.100 and 0.114 (kPa) in PTF1 to 0.071 and 0.098 in PTF3, and 0.072 and 0.097 in PTF11, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate the practical applicability of estimating Pc through the integration of soil properties and spectral indices. The findings highlight the potential of remote sensing technologies, such as spectral indices, as effective and cost-efficient tools for studying soil compaction. The proposed methodology contributes to our understanding of soil compaction processes and provides valuable insights for developing sustainable land management strategies.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: The forest industry has deployed systems of information and communication technology to improve the productivity of forest supply chains. In this sense, the digitalization of data flows significantly impacts wood supply chains, from forest to mills, which must react flexibly to market fluctuations of forest products. The goal of this study was to conduct a literature review on data flow implementations in management systems of wood supply chains and to evaluate their applicability in supply chains to analyze the opportunities for improving them in practice. Recent Findings: We utilized the ScienceDirect database, Scopus, and Web of Science in order to document data flows in systems and actual applications. Due to ongoing outsourcing, the wood procurement chains and the wood supply chains were identified in the forest industry. In addition to industrial wood data, several different data collection technologies can be implemented in wood supply chains to digitalize the forest data depending on the specific needs of organizations. In this regard, the digitalization of big data causes significant changes in available data elements of practical operations that are integrated and standardized in the optimization and simulation systems. Summary: A modeling guide is suggested for accurate dynamic solution of problems of forest logistics. Then, the opportunities in digitalization for connecting different data flows, technologies, and stakeholders are discussed thoroughly. We conclude that data-driven dynamic optimization and locally implemented digitalization contribute to wood supply modeling in the ongoing establishment of standards for cloud-based platforms because modeling time-related and sequential measures will ensure successful forest logistics through planning and monitoring wood supply chains. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The difference in power demand and the driver's operation in various operation stages make the loader have the problem of low energy utilization. Changeable operating objects and drastically changing loads have exacerbated the difficulty of energy-saving research in different operating stages of loaders. Therefore, based on identifying the operation stage and analyzing the load characteristics under typical working conditions of the loader, this paper proposes a shovel-loading cooperative control strategy. Specifically, the Drag Reduction Insertion (DRI) in the shoveling stage is realized based on learning the driving intention. Based on different operation stages, the load characteristics of different materials for shovel-loading are deeply analyzed, and the prediction research of the power output characteristics of the power unit is carried out. The shovel-loading cooperative control solves the problem of the poor economy caused by different power requirements in different operation stages and significantly reduces the impact of the driver's operating experience. © 2023 ISA},

An important part of this decarbonization process, along with the incorporation of renewable and alternative energies, is the emergence of Carbon-neutral, intelligent systems technologies, coupled with digital transformation. These have brought new dynamics to the electric power systems transformation. Significant amounts of renewable energy, massive power electronics, changes in market planning, policy influence, demand response, and emerging technologies all become the essential components of new power systems, bringing remarkable changes to this new power systems' enabling technologies: IntelliSense. A novel IntelliSense framework driven by new power system requirements is proposed. The development status, classification characteristics, the application of intelligent sensors, intelligent sensor flexible charging, and multisource plus multidimensional big data processing are all discussed in detail. They are interspersed with discussions of critical features of new power systems, the uncertainties inherent in big data about power, wireless power transfer technologies, edge-fog-cloud collaborative computing, intelligent algorithms, and other core elements of IntelliSense. Finally, ten core IntelliSense technology challenges and five major future opportunities are summarized and are expected to serve as a reference and spark new ideas for low-carbon power system development. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Food production sustainability is one of contemporary agriculture’s fundamental challenges. Farmers are currently facing high input prices in crop production and declining organic matter in the soil. For this reason, a field experiment was established to assess the effect of the biostimulant NeOsol (NS), the manure stabilizer Z’fix (ZF), farmyard manure (FM), and their combination in farm practice. In situ measurements provided information on the change in bulk density (BD), unit draft (UD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC), and cone index (CI). Furthermore, the vegetation status was investigated via vegetation indices, and the yield and quality parameters were assessed. Management of the experimental field resulted in an overall decrease in BD over time for the treated variants compared to the control (CL). The decrease with time was also verified in the case of UD and CI at the depth zone of 10–20 cm. Variants FM (by 8.0%), FM_NS (by 7.3%), and FM_ZF_NS (by 3.8%) proved to have lower UD values than CL. An overall increase in SHC and in yield was observed over time. Concerning SHC, only FM (by 58.5%) proved different from CL. The yield of all the treated variants, i.e., NS (by 8.2%), FM (by 10.8%), FM_NS (by 14.1%), FM_ZF (by 17.8%), and FM_ZF_NS (by 20.1%), surpassed CL. Simultaneously, none of the examined treatments proved to have any adverse effect either on soil or on plant-related variables. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The transport sector is under an intensive renovation process. Innovative concepts such as shared and intermodal mobility, mobility as a service, and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will contribute to the transition toward carbon neutrality and are foreseen as crucial parts of future mobility systems, as demonstrated by worldwide efforts in research and industry communities. The main driver of CAVs development is road safety, but other benefits, such as comfort and energy saving, are not to be neglected. CAVs analysis and development usually focus on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) research themes and less on the entire vehicle system. Many studies on specific aspects of CAVs are available in the literature, including advanced powertrain control strategies and their effects on vehicle efficiency. However, most studies neglect the additional power consumption due to the autonomous driving system. This work aims to assess uncertain CAVs&amp;#x2019; efficiency improvements and offers an overview of their architecture. In particular, a combination of the literature survey and proper statistical methods are proposed to provide a comprehensive overview of CAVs. The CAV layout, data processing, and management to be used in energy management strategies are discussed. The data gathered are used to define statistical distribution relative to the efficiency improvement, number of sensors, computing units and their power requirements. Those distributions have been employed within a Monte Carlo method simulation to evaluate the effect on vehicle energy consumption and energy saving, using optimal driving behaviour, and considering the power consumption from additional CAV hardware. The results show that the assumption that CAV technologies will reduce energy consumption compared to the reference vehicle, should not be taken for granted. In 75% of scenarios, simulated light-duty CAVs worsen energy efficiency, while the results are more promising for heavy-duty vehicles. © 2024 by the authors.},

Previous studies extensively discussed the electrification of private vehicles, but few studies focused on the agricultural machinery (AM) which is highly polluting. An analysis of the benefits of electric agricultural machinery (EAM) is essential for effectively promoting the development and dissemination of related technologies. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the carbon emission reduction benefits of EAM. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of AM carbon emissions in China from 2000 to 2020 using cluster analysis, and proposed a top-down assessment framework integrating machine learning methods and Bass-diffusion model to quantitatively assess the market penetration and carbon reduction potential of EAM under different scenarios. The results showed that AM cumulative carbon emissions, AM carbon emissions, and AM carbon emissions share coefficients varied significantly among Chinese provinces. The permeability of EAM development varied significantly in different scenarios. The implementation of active planning-type policies will greatly promote the electrification of AM, bringing significant carbon emission reduction benefits compared to the market-driven scenario. The results provide basic information for formulating and promoting EAM-related policies in China. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Field-road mode classification (FRMC) that identifies “in-field” and “on-road” categories for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) trajectory points of agricultural machinery containing geographic information is essential for effective crop improvement. Most previous studies utilize local trajectory features (i.e., the relationships between a point and its neighboring points), but they ignore global trajectory features (i.e., the relationships between the point and all points of the trajectory), leading to difficulty in improving the overall classification performance. The global trajectory features are useful for FRMC because they contain rich trajectory information (e.g., mode switching and motion tendency). Therefore, a ConvTEBiLSTM network-based method is proposed to improve the overall performance. Firstly, nine statistical features (e.g., speed and direction) are extracted from the original data and fed into the ConvTEBiLSTM network. Then, the ConvTEBiLSTM network combining the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network, 1D Convolution network, and Transformer-Encoder network is used to extract and fuse local and global trajectory features. Finally, a linear classifier is applied to identify the “field” and “road” categories of GNSS points based on the fused features. Experimental results show that compared with the baselines, our method achieves the best accuracy and F1-score of 97.38% and 92.74% on our Harvester dataset, respectively. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The advent of smart agriculture has revolutionized agricultural management. It is an emerging technology that uses modern sensing and communication technologies such as internet of things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics and automation and artificial intelligence. The technology recognizes the factors responsible for diminished agricultural yields and helps to track them in a real-time mode. Simultaneous monitoring of qualitative and quantitative improvement in the agricultural production, optimization of parameters such as environmental conditions, soil conditions, plant growth and its health can be done on a real-time basis. Interestingly, the data collected from various sensors with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be utilized to measure parameters that ensures better plant growth for enhancing agricultural management. On the contrary, manual intervention can be reduced to the maximum as the wireless monitoring of plant parameters provides accurate status of plant nutrition and health. Furthermore, the technology focuses on development of devices and tools to monitor, display, and inform the farmers regarding agricultural parameters. The recent development of IoT-based robotics and automation lead to dynamic, fast, and accurate farming with increase in agricultural yields. Additionally, geological and meteorological information existing as numerical, or image data could be analyzed promptly using artificial intelligence. This would further help to make an effective decision on pest control, fertilizer usage, and water management, etc. This chapter reviews the existing and emerging sensors along with wireless network, IoT, artificial intelligence, and other communication technologies, focused on agricultural industry. It also discusses the existing practical difficulties and implementation challenges of the latest technologies; also extends discussion on the future direction of smart agriculture. © 2023 River Publishers.

	abstract = {Autonomous agricultural management combats the labor crisis in farming industry and ensures efficient farm operations, whereas variable rate technology has proven to increase resource use efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. This study developed an autonomous robot-driven combined site-specific seeding and nitrogen (N) fertilization solution, whose agro-economic and environmental viability was evaluated in maize. A commercial field in Belgium was scanned using a mobile on-line visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy for predicting soil organic carbon (OC), pH, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and moisture content (MC). The six on-line soil layers were fused to delineate a management zone (MZ) map and derive recommendations for site-specific applications. Recommendations for site-specific seeding (SSS) and site-specific N fertilization (SNF) were implemented with a precision seeder and fertilizer sprayer, respectively, coupled to a field robot. Based on the fertility status, each MZ class was sown with one of the seed rates of 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 kSeeds ha−1 by seeding densely in the highly fertile MZ and vice versa (i.e., Kings approach). On the fourth day after seeding, variable N rates of 87, 81, 75, 67, 61 kg N ha−1 were applied according to two strategies, namely, Kings (KA – feeding the rich) and Robin Hood (RHA – feeding the poor). Results showed that SSS followed by SNF-RHA improved grain yield (9.96 t ha−1), compared to uniform rate (UR) (9.74 t ha−1) and SNF-KA (9.52 t ha−1) treatments, hence, increased gross margin by 53 € ha−1, compared to UR. SNF-KA consumed lower N and seed inputs than SNF-RHA and UR, while SNF-RHA used slightly more N by 1.5 kg N ha−1, compared to UR. This SNF-RHA was more profitable than the other two treatments. SNF-RHA also resulted in comparable yields across different MZ classes, by recommending complementary N doses, which was not the case for the SNF-KA. In conclusion, autonomous robot-driven combined maize SSS and SNF-RHA solution is proven to be technically feasible, while being profitable and time-efficient, allowing farmers to do multi-tasks simultaneously. Future work should evaluate the proposed integrated technology solution on different crops and a large number of fields to generalise the results achieved to promote practical applications by farmers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and building information modeling (BIM) have been applied to inspect building surfaces to improve efficiency and reduce labor costs. However, most of the current research focus on the inspection mode of “first collect and then identify” with limited intelligence. Therefore, this study proposes a “global-local” adaptive inspection method for building surfaces by integrating BIM, UAV (with multifunction camera), and edge computing, enabling real-time synchronization of crack data collection and analysis. First, the building surface area to be inspected is extracted from BIM to generate global inspection points using the selected camera's field of view (FOV) and considering coordinates transformation between BIM and reality. Then, A star algorithm integrating with genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the global flight path based on generated inspection points. Finally, the coordinates of the inspection points based on BIM are converted into real-world coordinates, and the flight parameters such as the flight yaw angle (FYA) and the gimbal yaw angle (GYA) are calculated to generate the inspection mission. During global inspection, a local adaptive inspection is proposed for each FOV through real-time local crack identification and flight replanning using edge computing and zoom camera. In addition, multiple battery supply points are automatically added considering the endurance of the UAV. A real building has been used to validate the proposed “global-local” adaptive inspection method. The experiment results show that the inspection time has been significantly reduced compared with the traditional method, and the crack identification of building surfaces can be implemented with high efficiency, precision, quality, and low cost. © 2023},

	abstract = {It is necessary to observe the relationship between the energy inputs and outputs of agricultural production in the context of long-term strategies to determine optimal sustainable solutions and identify the most susceptible system components. Comprehensive research to assess energy performance data over a relatively long-term is required to predict crop production and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on energy inputs. This study collects and analyzes energy inputs and GHG emissions from 17 crops of Iran in five major categories (cereal, pulse, oilseed, fiber, and tubers) during 1970–2019 to quantify the long-term energy efficiency of major crops. Three machine learning (ML) algorithms are developed to quantify the relationship between the resources consumed per unit of energy output and GHG emission models. These models are evaluated through three quantitative statistics. The analysis considers all physical and chemical inputs used to produce the major crops. These energy variables include human labor, machinery, fossil fuels, electricity, irrigation water, fertilizers (phosphate, nitrogen, and potassium), pesticides and seed rate. The results revealed that the input and output energy values increased from 39.47 to 190.18 MJ ha-1 in 1970 to 253.43 and 654 MJ ha−1 in 2019. The GHG emissions from electricity (47.1%) were followed by those of nitrogen fertilizer (25.75%). Reducing the consumption of electricity and nitrogen fertilizers is the most efficient options to improve the energy efficiency of the crops studied. © 2023},

The main challenge of these networks is energy efficiency; typically, sensor nodes are powered by tiny batteries with limited capacity. This research suggests a Q-learning-based routing algorithm for optimizing WSN lifespan and sending vast amounts of data in smart home applications. The suggested routing approach takes advantage of the benefits of Q-learning to discover the ideal routing path to transmit data with the least amount of energy dissipation. To simulate the WSN in a smart home environment, the simulation is implemented in 3D. The presented routing method is evaluated in comparison to three different protocols: QLRP, EQL, and Dijkstra. The findings show that the created routing approach surpasses the other protocols in terms of prolonging WSN lifetime, total transferred data, and energetic network cost. © 2023,International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

	abstract = {Electricity is establishing ground as a means of energy, and its proportion will continue to rise in the next generations. Home energy usage is expected to increase by more than 40% in the next 20 years. Therefore, to compensate for demand requirements, proper planning and strategies are needed to improve home energy management systems (HEMs). One of the crucial aspects of HEMS are proper load forecasting and scheduling of energy utilization. Energy management systems depend heavily on precise forecasting and scheduling. Considering this scenario, this article was divided into two parts. Firstly, this article gives a thorough analysis of forecasting models in HEMs with the primary goal of determining whichever model is most appropriate in a given situation. Moreover, for optimal utilization of scheduling strategies in HEMs, the current literature has discussed a number of scheduling optimization approaches. Therefore, secondly in this article, these approaches will be examined thoroughly to develop effective operating scheduling and to make wise judgments regarding usage of these techniques in HEMs. Finally, this paper also presents the future technical advancements and research gaps in load forecasting and scheduling and how they affect HEMs activities in the near future. © 2024 The Authors},

This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive and thorough overview of the current state of vehicle control technology, focusing on the evolution from vehicle state estimation and trajectory tracking control in AVs at the microscopic level to collaborative control in CAVs at the macroscopic level. First, this review starts with vehicle key state estimation, specifically vehicle sideslip angle, which is the most pivotal state for vehicle trajectory control, to discuss representative approaches. Then, we present symbolic vehicle trajectory tracking control approaches for AVs. On top of that, we further review the collaborative control frameworks for CAVs and corresponding applications. Finally, this survey concludes with a discussion of future research directions and the challenges. This survey aims to provide a contextualized and in-depth look at the state-of-the-art in vehicle control for AVs and CAVs, identifying critical areas of focus and pointing out the potential areas for further exploration.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work aims to construct an artificial neural network (ANN) ant colony algorithm (ACA)-based fine recognition system for plant factory seedling phenotypes. To address the problems of complexity and high delay of the plant recognition system in plant factories, first, multiple cameras at different positions are employed to collect images of seedlings and construct 3D images. Then, the mask region convolutional neural networks (MRCNN) algorithm is adopted to analyze plant phenotypes. Finally, the optimized ACA is employed to optimize the process timing in the plant factory, thereby constructing a plant factory seedling phenotype fine identification system via ANN combined with ACA. Moreover, the model performance is analyzed. The results show that plants have four stages of phenotypes, namely, the germination stage, seedling stage, rosette stage, and heading stage. The accuracy of the germination stage reaches 97.01%, and the required test time is 5.64 s. Additionally, the optimization accuracy of the process timing sequence of the proposed model algorithm is maintained at 90.26%, and the delay and energy consumption are stabilized at 20.17 ms and 17.71, respectively, when the data volume is 6000 Mb. However, the problem of image acquisition occlusion in the process of 3D image construction still needs further study. Therefore, the constructed ANN-ACA-based fine recognition system for plant seedling phenotypes can optimize the process timing in a more real-time and lower energy consumption way and provide a reference for the integrated progression of unmanned intelligent recognition systems and complete sets of equipment for plant plants in the later stage. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Conventional large agricultural machinery or implements are unsafe and unsuitable to operate on slopes (Formula presented.) or 10%. Tractor rollovers are frequent on slopes, precluding farming on arable hills, uneven or highly sloped land. Therefore, a fleet of autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) is proposed to cultivate highly sloped land ((Formula presented.)). The fleet aims to expand agricultural land to the slopes and to strengths the human-robot collaboration in an unsafe sloped environment. However, the fleet's success largely depends on vehicle behavior models regarding traction, mobility, and energy consumption on varying slopes. The vehicle intelligent behavior models are essential and would solve multiple objectives ranging from simulations to path planning & navigation. Therefore, this study aimed to build a deep learning-based vehicle behavior models on sloping terrain. A standard drawbar test was performed on a single AGV operating on an actual sloped field at varying speeds and load conditions. The drawbar test quantified the AGV's behavior on slopes in metrics related to traction (traction efficiency), mobility (travel reduction), and energy consumption (power number). Deep learning-based models were developed from the experimental data to predict the AGV's behavior on slopes as a function of vehicle velocity, drawbar, and slope. A special model called the proposed model, which combined multiple deep neural networks with a mixture of Gaussians, was developed and trained with a hybrid training method. The proposed model consistently outperformed the other well-known machine learning models. This study explored the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to simulate the behavior of small-track vehicle or AGV on sloping terrain. The fleet aims to provide safer agriculture keeping human safety in focus, and the developed predictive vehicle behavior models would empower the fleet's operation on currently unsafe sloped terrain by assisting in vehicle path planning, route optimization, and decision making. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {This study was primarily conducted to investigate the potential use of pumpkin seed oil in biodiesel production. Initially, the fatty acid composition of oils extracted from discarded pumpkin seeds was determined. Then, biodiesel produced from discarded pumpkin seed oil was tested in an engine test setup. The performance and emission values of a four-cylinder diesel engine fueled with diesel (D100), biodiesel (PB100), and blended fuels (PB2D98, PB5D95, and PB20D80) were determined. Furthermore, three distinctive machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, XGBoost, and random forest) were employed to model engine performance and emission parameters. Models were generated based on the data from the PB100, PB2D98, and PB5D95 fuels, and model performance was assessed through the R2, RMSE, and MAPE metrics. The highest torque value (333.15 Nm) was obtained from 1200 rpm of D100 fuel. PB2D98 (2% biodiesel–98% diesel) had the lowest specific fuel consumption (194.33 g HPh−1) at 1600 rpm. The highest BTE (break thermal efficiency) value (30.92%) was obtained from diesel fuel at 1400 rpm. Regarding the blended fuels, PB2D98 exhibited the most fuel-efficient performance. Overall, in terms of engine performance and emission values, PB2M98 showed the closest results to diesel fuel. A comparison of machine learning algorithms revealed that artificial neural networks (ANNs) generally performed the best. However, the XGBoost algorithm proved to be more successful than other algorithms at predicting the performance and emissions of PB20D80 fuel. The present findings demonstrated that the XGBoost algorithm could be a more reliable option for predicting engine performance and emissions, especially for data-deficient fuels such as PB20D80. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study provides a high-level overview of alternative energy sources that can be harnessed to power agricultural operations, focusing on renewable energy technologies. When thinking about the overall economy around the globe, agriculture is vital. Energy is required at each step of production, from fertilizer production to fueling tractors for planting and harvesting. The high energy prices and unpredictable energy market significantly affect the input energy costs. Energy efficiency methods, when properly applied, and the use of farm's renewable energy sources could assist agricultural producers in saving energy-related costs. Renewable energy resources in the form of solar, biomass, wind, and geothermal energy are abundantly available in the agriculture sector. This review aims to explore renewable energy as an alternative energy source for efficient energy management in agriculture. It discusses the potential benefits, challenges, and opportunities associated with adopting renewable energy technologies in the agricultural sector. Our research adds value by presenting a comprehensive overview of alternative energy sources and their applicability in energy management. By highlighting the benefits and potential challenges associated with each option, we provide valuable insights for agricultural stakeholders and researchers aiming to transition toward sustainable energy practices in the sector. Better energy management is intertwined with problems that need a broader strategy than has so far been used. In a nutshell, transitioning to alternative energy sources for energy management in agriculture holds great promise for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainability in food production. However, successful implementation requires addressing technical, economic, and policy barriers while fostering knowledge dissemination and capacity building among farmers and stakeholders. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Specifically, it provided an overview of the various benefits that these technologies can deliver with the most significant ones revealing reductions of up to 80 % in fertiliser usage with RMT and CTF applications, while VRT demonstrated a 60 % decrease in fertiliser usage and up to 80 % reduction in pesticide use. VRT also showed an increase in yield by 62 %. RSSM was able to reduce labour by 97 % and diesel consumption by 50 %. FMIS improved yield by 10 % to 15 %, facilitating simultaneous reductions in labour and input costs, illustrating the critical role of integrated digital solutions in enhancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability. From an environmental point of view, VRT has emerged as a major factor in environmental sustainability, demonstrating water savings of 20 % to 50 % in vineyards and pear orchards and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Most existing medium access control protocols are based on scheduling the standby and active periods of nodes and do not consider the alarm state. This paper proposes a Q-learning and efficient low-quantity charge (QL-ELQC) method for the smoke alarm unit of a power system to reduce the average current and to improve the lifetime of the wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes. Quantity charge models were set up, and the QL-ELQC method is based on the duty cycle of the standby and active times for the nodes and considers the relationship between the sensor data condition and the RF module that can be activated and deactivated only at a certain time. The QL-ELQC method effectively overcomes the continuous state–action space limitation of Q-learning using the state classification method. The simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme significantly improves the latency and energy efficiency compared with the existing QL-Load scheme. Moreover, the experimental results are consistent with the theoretical results. The proposed QL-ELQC approach can be applied in various scenarios where batteries cannot be replaced or recharged under harsh environmental conditions. © 2023 by the authors.},

Thus, this paper aims to develop an electro-hydraulic press for dynamically measuring elastic deformations occurring in agricultural tires. The experiment used a completely randomized design, evaluating two pneumatic wheelsets, bias-ply and radial, and six vertical loads, 4.9033, 9.8066, 14.71, 19.6133, 24.5166, and 29.4199 kN, on the tire, totalizing 12 treatments with five repetitions. The analyzed parameters are contact area, horizontal and vertical deflection. The collected data underwent an analysis of variance F-test and a polynomial regression analysis. The results showed continuous replicability of the data obtained with the electro-hydraulic press. That demonstrates the efficiency of the developed device for evaluating agricultural tires in a controlled environment. The bias-ply tire presented a smaller contact area than the radial with the increase of incident loads, and the 14.71 kN load achieved a higher amplitude, generating a difference of 40 %. The maximum load resulted in 27 % more horizontal deflections for the radial tire. However, the vertical deflection values were 8 % higher with the bias-ply tires. © 2023},

	abstract = {The article reviewed the four major Bioinspired intelligent algorithms for agricultural applications, namely ecological, swarm-intelligence-based, ecology-based, and multi-objective algorithms. The key emphasis was placed on the variants of the swarm intelligence algorithms, namely the artificial bee colony (ABC), genetic algorithm, flower pollination algorithm (FPA), particle swarm, the ant colony, firefly algorithm, artificial fish swarm, and Krill herd algorithm because they had been widely employed in the agricultural sector. There was a broad consensus among scholars that certain BIAs' variants were more effective than others. For example, the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm and genetic algorithm were best suited for farm machinery path optimization and pest detection, among other applications. On the contrary, the particle swarm algorithm was useful in determining the plant evapotranspiration rates, which predicted the water requirements and optimization of the irrigation process. Despite the promising applications, the adoption of hyper-heuristic algorithms in agriculture remained low. No universal algorithm could perform multiple functions in farms; different algorithms were designed to perform specific functions. Secondary concerns relate to data integrity and cyber security, considering the history of cyber-attacks on smart farms. Despite the concerns, the benefits associated with the BIAs outweighed the risks. On average, farmers can save 647–1866 L on fuel which is equivalent to US$734-851, with the use of GPS-guided systems. The accuracy of the BIAs mitigated the risk of errors in applying pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation, and crop monitoring for better yields. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Energy harvesting (EH) provides a promising solution for powering distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Due to the low-level and sporadic ambient energy supply, an EH-powered device should operate in an intermittent and energy-driven mode. Commercial voltage supervisors were not optimized for the EH scenario, making it difficult to satisfy all new demands. The conventional energy management (EM) circuit has a risk of locking up during the turn-ON transient; therefore, it might fail to power the IoT load device. Previous technologies have used a relatively large circuit to solve this problem. In this article, a concise discrete three-transistor EM (3T-EM) circuit is proposed. It can track stored energy, switch ON/OFF to the load device, and provide a regulated voltage output. These key functions are realized by utilizing a minimum number of components; therefore, power consumption and manufacturing cost are largely cut. The voltage thresholds and minimum input current are theoretically derived. In experiments, the ON/OFF thresholds can be adjusted accurately, as predicted by the theory. The 3T-EM circuit can ensure the correct operation when the input current is as low as 0.4μA. Control experiments also prove the effectiveness and performance of the 3T-EM circuit. The proposed 3T-EM circuit shows the characteristics of low cost, low power, inherent regulation, high voltage rating, and good predictability. It is a good candidate to perform the EM task in widely distributed EH-powered IoT devices.  © 2014 IEEE.},

In spite of the demonstrated benefits of the application of Information Technology to improve agricultural practices, such as yield increase and input reduction, in Italy its adoption still lags behind. In order to understand limits of and perspectives on the adoption of such technologies, we conducted an explorative study. A survey with a choice experiment was carried out in Italy among 471 farmers and people interested in agricultural machinery and technologies. The results highlight how specific factors, such as excessive costs and lack of incentive policies, may limit the spread of precision agriculture. Conversely, the provision of adequate technical support would likely favor its adoption. Furthermore, latent class modeling was used to identify three segments of potential buyers: sustainability seekers; precision agriculture best features supporters; low emissions fans. Potential policy and market implications of this explorative study are discussed in the conclusion. © 2023, The Author(s).},

First, this research designs a 3D path planning method based on the PSO optimization algorithm with the goal of achieving optimal energy consumption during UAV flight operations. Then, to overcome the limitations of the classical PSO algorithm, such as poor global search capability and susceptibility to local optimality, a parameter adaptive method based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is introduced. This parameter adaptive method dynamically adjusts the main parameters of the PSO algorithm by monitoring the state of the particle swarm solution set. Finally, the improved PSO algorithm based on parameter adaptive improvement is applied to path planning in mountainous terrain environments, and an optimal energy-consuming path-planning algorithm for UAVs based on the improved PSO algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the path-planning algorithm proposed in this research effectively reduces non-essential energy consumption during UAV flight operations, especially in more complex terrain scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the rapid increase of installed capacity of renewable energy power generation,unstable conditions such as variable load and unstable combustion during deep peak regulation put forward higher requirements for combustion optimization control of thermal power units. The rapidly developing artificial intelligence technology and deep learning algorithm provides an important means for boiler parameter prediction modeling and optimization. In terms of machine learning algorithms, this paper summarized the research status of feature screening and modeling algorithms, and pointed out that traditional statistical methods and linear dimensionality reduction methods had poor scientific interpretation and can not identify high-dimensional data well, and feature screening methods combined with deep learning algorithms had more obvious advantages in processing complex thermal power unit data. The advantages and disadvantages of various neural networks in NOx emission concentration modeling were compared. Among them, long short-term memory neural network and convolutional neural network have better effects in processing time series data, and the integrated model can improve the generalization ability and robustness of the whole model by combining the advantages of different learners. In the application of prediction model, the establishment of prediction model for SCR denitration system can facilitate operators to simulate and modify adjustable parameters, and at the same time, it can be used as a soft measurement method to monitor the operating state of the combustion system. Advanced control methods, such as feedforward control and model predictive control, which introduce NOx emission concentration prediction model, can effectively improve the poor effect of traditional PID control for thermal power units. In multi-objective optimization, NOx removal efficiency and boiler efficiency or denitrification cost are usually used as optimization objectives, in order to achieve the harmonious unity of economic and social benefits. © 2024 China International Book Trading Corp.

This paper is focused on the deep analysis of smart farming-related components such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communication technology, sensors, and hardware. There is serious concern about selecting technology, sensors, and hardware in the different agriculture practices. This may result in an increase in mechanization among various agricultural practices in an easy way. This paper provides a systematic extensive review of the implication of automation in agriculture.

	abstract = {As one of the world's most significant staple crops, rice has played a crucial part in meeting the primary demand for food for inhabitants across the globe. China and India are the two major producers and consumers of rice as compared to the rest of the world. Despite that, several environmental and health hazards are associated with rice residue, i.e., rice straw. In recent years, the emission of greenhouse gases, deterioration of the soil characteristics and production of hazardous smog have become significant issues that are usually faced during the open-field burning of rice straw in the northern region of India. Several studies have validated the alarming threats of these issues, but on the ground level, suitable measures are yet to be taken. The present review article aims to provide comprehensive details about the utilization of rice straw in various in-situ and ex-situ technologies while highlighting the physical, chemical, thermal and biological characteristics for its application in upcoming technologies with a special emphasis on Northern India. Apart from that, particular emphasis has been given to the initiatives commenced by the government of India for the management of rice straw. A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis has been carried out to mitigate the problems related to rice straw, followed by a brief discussion of future perspectives along with sustainable development goals. The data outlined in the article is anticipated to aid the researchers, stakeholders and concerned authorities in improvising the existing practices or to attain new findings for the sustainable management of rice straw.

	abstract = {Mobile robot path planning refers to the design of the safely collision-free path with shortest distance and least time-consuming from the starting point to the end point by a mobile robot autonomously. In this paper, a systematic review of mobile robot path planning techniques is presented. Firstly, path planning is classified into global path planning and local path planning according to the mastery of environmental information. In the global path planning, environment modeling methods and path evaluation method are introduced. The methods of environment modeling include grid method, topology method, geometric feature method and mixed representation method. In the local path planning, we introduce the sensors commonly used in the detection environment, including laser radar and visual sensor. Next, according to the characteristics of algorithms, mobile robot path planning algorithms are divided into three categories: classical algorithms, bionic algorithms and artificial intelligence algorithms. Among the classical algorithms, we introduce the cell decomposition method, sampling based method, graph search algorithm, artificial potential field method and dynamic window method.

	abstract = {An accurate, timely and large-scale yield prediction is considered critically important to frame policies to mitigate climate change risks and for ensured food security. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), being a major cereal grain crop of north-western India, has been highly energy intensive with large emissions of greenhouse gases, affecting ecosystems’ sustainability. We therefore, performed energy optimization in wheat for enhanced ecosystems’ resilience and carbon (C) sustainability, while predicting yields of 120 intensive wheat production systems across north-western India. An integrated approach of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning (ML) models was applied for energy optimization and accurate yield prediction. After optimization of energy input in wheat production, 8 different ML models of variable complexity viz. linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LAR), elastic net regression (ENR), decision tree regression (DT), random forest regression (RF), gradient boosting regression (GB) and support vector regression (SVR) were applied and evaluated statistically for accurate prediction of wheat yields of studied decision making units (DMUs). These results revealed that wheat ecosystems have a high total input energy (EI) of 24.7 GJ ha−1, which comprises ~46.5% share of direct and 53.5% of indirect energy sources. The non-renewable energy input was ~3.9 times higher than the renewable energy. The total C equivalent emissions of 1815.7 kg CO2e ha−1 comprised the highest share of chemical fertilizers (~49.8%), and exhibited a linear significant relationship with EI (R2 = 0.8117**; p < 0.01). Nitrogenous fertilizers application contributes ~90.1% towards total fertilizer related energy input in wheat production. The net global warming potential of 2.30 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 was estimated which resulted in yield scaled emissions (i.e., greenhouse gases intensity) of 0.34 kg CO2e kg−1 wheat grain yield. The DEA-based benchmarking showed that the technical efficiency (TE) score of 79 DMUs was < 1.00, elucidated ~65% DMUs as energy inefficient. The average (n = 120) TE score of 0.92 illustrates energy saving possibility of 2464.6 MJ ha−1 (~8% of EI), mostly via efficient fertilizer (54.4%) and irrigation water management (11.6%). The 1:1 (x = y) correspondence analysis implies that DT, GB, and RF models can accurately predict wheat productivity with significantly higher R2 values of 0.998** (p < 0.01), 0.950** (p < 0.01), and 0.832* (p < 0.05), respectively. These results underpin overwhelming significance of DEA-based energy optimization for wheat ecosystems, which helps reduce the energy and C footprints for sustainable and cleaner production. Nonetheless, DT, GB, and RF models outperformed in yield prediction with the lowest root mean square error and normalized mean square error, but the highest Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and index of agreement. Therefore, DEA-based benchmarking has significant energy saving potential, while DT, GB, and RF models have highly accurate wheat yield prediction abilities for north-western India. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo 2024.},

	abstract = {Drying plays a crucial role in preserving the quality of agricultural products. Nevertheless, suboptimal conditions in drying systems have an adverse effect on drying characteristics and energy efficiency. Machine learning approaches are innovative and reliable that have been successfully used to solve such challenges and achieve optimization in drying processes. In this study, five machine learning approaches (multilayer perceptron [MLP], gaussian processes [GP], support vector regression [SVR], k-nearest neighbors [kN], and random forest [RF]) were used to estimate moisture content and moisture ratio of apricot in five various dryers (convective [CV], microwave [MW], infrared [IR], microwave-convective [MW-CV], and infrared-convective [IR-CV]). Also, the values of specific energy consumption (SEC) and effective moisture diffusivity (Deff) were calculated in these dryers. Accordingly, the best result of the Deff (3.14 × 10−10 m2/s) and the minimum value of the drying time (130 min) and SEC (18.67 MJ/kg) were obtained using MW-CV hybrid dryer. While the lowest values of Deff (2.09 × 10−11 m2/s) and highest drying time (18.5 h) and SEC (209.34 MJ/kg) were detected in CV dryer at 50°C. The best correlation coefficients (R) for the estimation of moisture content were gained using RF technique for k-fold cross validation and train-test split with the values of 0.9908 and 0.9912, respectively. Moreover, moisture ratio results showed that the MLP achieved the highest R value over 0.9985 for both validation methodologies. In the discrimination of the drying methods, the MLP had the greatest accuracy as 82.00% and 86.00% for k-fold cross validation and train-test split, respectively. The results showed that the RF and ML models could potentially be used for estimation and discrimination for drying applications. Practical Applications: Recently, there has been an increased interest in healthy food choices such as foodstuffs, snacks, and dried products. This trend has captured the attention of both dietitians and conscious consumers. Apricots are a prime example of a valuable dried product that can be dry in various conditions. Machine learning techniques can be used for rapid and non-destructive determination of drying characteristics and such techniques yield objective and accurate results. Present findings revealed that texture machine learning models could be used as an effective and reliable discrimination tool for dried products. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {One of the most major agendas to mitigate climate change is the transition to low-carbon energy extraction. Furthermore, developing cutting-edge prototypes for wearable technology, innovative housing, transportation, telecommunications, sophisticated electronics, and other related technologies necessitates the use of clean and readily available energy sources, which has become a fundamental priority. Sentient beings (humans and wildlife) have a variety of biological, mechanical, and thermal energy sources. Using the energy from these sources might be a viable way to circumvent the increasing electricity demand. This study looks at a variety of low-carbon-emitting energy capture materials, methods, and approaches that have recently been applied for solar, wind, hydrogen, mechanoelectrical, and biological response. Furthermore, this article discusses the proven approaches for harvesting energy from human bodies for self-powered gadgets. We provide material considerations, system topologies, and functioning concepts for these power extractors, with an emphasis on low-carbon solutions. We investigate various power sources placed in or on pre-existing and anthropological models. We conclude the review by emphasising the significance of merging various energy extractors with cutting-edge circuitry, which provides a new foundation for developing creative designs for self-powered electronics in healthcare and textiles. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, this paper examines whether rural broadband adoption affects agricultural carbon reduction efficiency (ACRE), using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2019. This paper achieves a measurement of ACRE by taking the carbon sink of agricultural as one of the desired outputs and using a Slacks‐ Based Measure (SBM) model and the global Malmquist–Luenberger (GML) index. The results show that: (1) Rural broadband adoption has a positive effect on ACRE. The relationship between the income of rural residents and ACRE was an inverted U‐shaped, which confirms the EKC hypothesis. (2) Land transfer has a significant promoting effect on the relationship between rural broadband adoption and ACRE. When the land transfer rate is high, the positive effect of broadband adoption is obvious. (3) The positive effect of broadband adoption on ACRE was more obvious when farmers invested more in production equipment, that is to say, it has a significant positive moderating effect. As farmers in many developing countries suffer from increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events, we believe that the results of this study also have implications for the implementation of agricultural carbon reduction and smart agricultural equipment roll‐out in many countries. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Improving the resource utilization efficiency in irrigation systems contributes to the sustainability of the regional water-energy-grain nexus. Based on the water, energy and grain relationships quantification, the comprehensive efficiency (CE) of water transfer and grain production processes and its driving mechanism were analyzed, considering a pumping irrigation system in the Lianshui irrigation district (LID) in eastern China, as a case study. The annual crop output, crop water footprint, and electric energy consumption were estimated as 905.3 M kg (1 M = 106), 914.7 M m3 (50.7% blue water), and 3004.0 kWh, respectively, from 2005 to 2018; the corresponding crop water productivity (CWP), electricity energy productivity (EEP), water intake efficiency of electric energy (WIE) were 0.91 kg/m3, 80.39 kg/kJ, and 75.22 m3/kJ, respectively. CWP, EEP, and WIE varied among crops; however, none of the three indicators showed an obvious trend of change with time. The CE of integrated grain was 0.48 and showed an increase over time, indicating that the sustainability of the studied pumping irrigation system was improving. The driving effect of artificial factors (e. g. social development, agricultural input, and water management) on the CE was more obvious than that of natural conditions (e. g. climate). Increasing agricultural machinery and urbanization rates and reducing the agricultural water rate are conducive to improving the resource utilization efficiency in pumping irrigation systems. The analysis framework coupling water footprint and traditional paradigms proposed in this paper provides a feasible approach for the stability and sustainability of irrigated agricultural systems observation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the field of aerial photography, UAVs can be used as an ideal carrier of sensors. It is meaningful to plan its coverage path combined with the sensor model. Previous works mainly used decentralized coverage to realize UAV formation cooperative operation, but for the aerial photography scene of a single task, the decentralized coverage algorithm is not effective. In this paper, a centralized coverage algorithm of UAV formation for aerial photography is proposed, which is divided into two sub-problems: coverage path planning and formation control. In the coverage path planning, due to high repetition rate and excessive number of turns of the traditional PRM algorithm, the constraint of the number of turns is introduced, and the back-and-forth mode is used to improve it. In formation control, in order to more accurately evaluate the performance of the coverage path, it refers to the consensus theory and combines the artificial potential field method to guide the reverse-V UAV formation to follow the coverage path. Multi-group simulations show that the proposed algorithm is feasible to implement the concentrated coverage for aerial photography under the comprehensive consideration of path length, number of turns, calculation time, coverage rate and repeating rate.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

This study deals with development and performance assessments of a robot for this purpose. The robot comprised four major units including control, electro-hydraulic actuator, communication, and monitoring unit. Detailed descriptions of the units and their main components are beyond the scope of current report. Meanwhile, the robot has movable and stationary parts. The movable part is a wheeled mobile robot which guides suction tube in the confined space. Robotic evacuation operations are accomplished by supervisory remote control at base station with feedback from camera video of the mobile robot. Simulation results showed accurate performance of defined objectives for the units and their main components through designed hydraulic and electronic circuits. Stationary assessments for forward speed (0–30 m/min) and drawbar pull (-0-755.6 N) of the mobile robot yielded acceptable results in case of robot mobility. Operational assessments of the robot in two chemical reactors comprised depreciated catalyst and ceramic balls practically approved efficient, safe, feasible, and easily implementable of robotic evacuation operations. Overall, the robot proposed in this study eliminates employment of a human in highly risky conditions of industrial confined spaces. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Technology solutions must effectively balance economic growth, social equity, and environmental integrity to achieve a sustainable society. Notably, although the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm constitutes a key sustainability enabler, critical issues such as the increasing maintenance operations, energy consumption, and manufacturing/disposal of IoT devices have long-term negative economic, societal, and environmental impacts and must be efficiently addressed. This calls for self-sustainable IoT ecosystems requiring minimal external resources and intervention, effectively utilizing renewable energy sources, and recycling materials whenever possible, thus encompassing energy sustainability. In this work, we focus on energy-sustainable IoT during the operation phase, although our discussions sometimes extend to other sustainability aspects and IoT lifecycle phases. Specifically, we provide a fresh look at energy-sustainable IoT and identify energy provision, transfer, and energy efficiency as the three main energy-related processes whose harmonious coexistence pushes toward realizing self-sustainable IoT systems. Their main related technologies, recent advances, challenges, and research directions are also discussed. Moreover, we overview relevant performance metrics to assess the energy-sustainability potential of a certain technique, technology, device, or network, together with target values for the next generation of wireless systems, and discuss protocol, integration, and implementation issues. Overall, this paper offers insights that are valuable for advancing sustainability goals for present and future generations.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The application of wireless power and data telemetry to implantable medical devices (IMDs) has grown dramatically in recent decades. Achieving a high data rate and high-power transmission efficiency (PTE) over the same inductive link remains challenging. This paper presents a power and data telemetry circuit over a single 13.56 MHz inductive link. On the transmitter (TX) side, a binary-phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation based on a Class-E amplifier that features a high modulation rate and a high quality (Q)-factor is proposed. A digital-assisted phase-locked-loop (PLL) is proposed on the receiver (RX) side as a BPSK demodulator to handle the long settling process. The maximum data rate can be extended to 1/4 of the carrier frequency. The prototype has been fabricated with a 180 nm BCD (Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS) process. The measurement shows that up to 31.25 mW of power can be delivered simultaneously with 3.39-Mbps of data transmission, while a 2 × 10−7 bit-error-rate (BER) can be ensured over a transmission distance of 5 mm. The peak PTE is 70%, whereas the RX energy efficiency is 183 pJ/bit.

Unfortunately, developing sophisticated inference-capable applications is still challenging due to the lack of platform support for more advanced (32-bit) microprocessors and specialized accelerators - -which can execute data-intensive machine learning tasks, but add complexity across the stack when dealing with intermittent power. We present Protean to bridge the platform gap for inference-capable battery-free sensors. Designed for runtime scalability, meeting the dynamic range of energy harvesters with matching heterogeneous processing elements like neural network accelerators. We develop a modular "plug-and-play"hardware platform, SuperSensor, with a reconfigurable energy storage circuit that powers a 32-bit ARM-based microcontroller with a convolutional neural network accelerator. An adaptive task-based runtime system, Chameleon, provides intermittency-proof execution of machine learning tasks across heterogeneous processing elements. The runtime automatically scales and dispatches these tasks based on incoming energy, current state, and programmer annotations. A code generator, Metamorph, automates conversion of ML models to intermittent safe execution across heterogeneous compute elements. We evaluate Protean with audio and image workloads and demonstrate up to 666x improvement in inference energy efficiency by enabling usage of modern computational elements within intermittent computing. Further, Protean provides up to 166% higher throughput compared to non-adaptive baselines.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Accurate, rapid, and nondestructive identification of rice seed varieties has great significance for agriculture and food security, a method based on information fusion and artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) combined with the hyperspectral imaging (HSI) of five kinds of rice seeds was proposed in this work. First, the spectral and image data were obtained from HSI, and the spectral data were preprocessed by detrending. Then, bootstrapping soft shrinkage (BOSS), variable iterative space shrinkage approach, successive projections algorithm, and principal component analysis were adopted to select feature variables from the spectral and image data. Next, the support vector machine (SVM) model was constructed based on the spectral and image feature variables. In order to further improve the classification accuracy of single feature model, the model based on fused feature was developed and it was finally optimized by AFSA. The research showed that the feature variables (114 spectral variables and 11 image variables) selected by BOSS were representative, and the model accuracy based on BOSS spectral and image features reached 91.48% and 70%, respectively. The performance of the SVM model based on fused feature was improved significantly, and the model accuracy reached 97.22%. After AFSA optimization, the model accuracy finally reached 99.44%. The above result confirmed that using AFSA to optimize the model based on fused feature could be a promising method to identify rice seed varieties. Practical application: Rapid and accurate identification of rice seed varieties contributes to establishment of online rice seed identification system. HSI combined with information fusion and AFSA can overcome the disadvantage of low accuracy of traditional nondestructive testing methods. The method proposed in this article can be recommended to be widely popularized in farms, grain markets, and market regulators. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Vertical centrifugal pump is a high specific speed centrifugal pump, which is usually with radial vane diffuser structure. As the core power equipment for large-scale irrigation projects and long-distance water transfer, the matching motor power for vertical centrifugal pump is huge and can reach 40 MW, and the efficiency directly determines its operating energy consumption. In order to reduce the energy consumption of vertical centrifugal pumps, an optimization on multi-components was proposed based on back propagation neural network (BPNN) and multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA). The matching of the hydraulic components was taken into account and the Plackett-Burman test design was used to screen out the optimal design variables from the 10 design parameters of the vane diffuser and the volute. Then, totally 106 sets of cases were sampled by using optimal Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), and an automatic numerical simulation optimization platform for the vertical centrifugal pump was built to quickly obtain the optimization objective values corresponding to each set of case. The BPNN was used to construct the high-precision nonlinear relationship between the optimization variables and the optimization objective. Finally, the optimal parameter combination of vane diffuser and volute was obtained through MIGA. The results showed that the performance parameters of vertical centrifugal pump could be more accurately predicted by using SST k-ω turbulence model. BPNN was an effective method to construct high-precision nonlinear relationship between pump design parameters and performance parameters. The efficiency of the optimized model under design condition reached 90.21%, which was 3.61 percentage points higher than that of the original model. The optimized vane diffuser and volute had a more obvious influence on the performance of vertical centrifugal pumps under design condition and part-load conditions. The matching between the vane diffuser and other hydraulic components was better, and the internal flow pattern of the vane diffuser was significantly improved after optimization. The optimization method proposed could provide a certain reference for the optimization design of centrifugal pumps. © 2022, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved.},

BFCs have proved themselves to be a potential solution for the problems of the real world such as energy crisis, wastewater treatment, desalination, and air and water pollution. The applications of this versatile technology are limitless. They have found their way into nutrient recovery, bioremediation, telemetry, wastewater treatment, and biosensors. Amidst all the advantages of utilizing BFCs, it is still seen to have limitations: electrode overpotential, and energy losses that are caused by various factors such as nature of inoculum, substrate concentration, pH, electrode material, surface area of electrode, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), configuration, and so on, all leading to a reduction in coulombic efficiency, maximum power density, and maximum voltage attained. Out of this, the physical and chemical properties of the three components, viz., PEM, anode, and cathode play a crucial role in determining the overall efficiency of the BFC. Hence the material, structure, and other properties of the three mentioned components are to be better understood and studied before choosing from a variety of choices. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Smart farming is a promising application area that relies on diverse intelligent and communication technologies to ease the outcome of the farming process. The multi-level processes in a farming scenario are automated through smart sensors and intelligent decision-making system. This article presents a smart sensor information processing method for controlling the farming devices' functions. This method is named smart sensing-based functional control (SSFC) that is devised to identify and mitigate the uncertainties in handling information. Uncertainties in information processing are addressed using Boltzmann machines (BM) with limited and effective layered processing. Based on the recommendations of the BM output, the dissemination of device controls is preceded. In particular, both analysis and control dissemination are filtered based on BM constraints and training sets, improving the devices' accuracy. With the help of experimental analysis and real-time data set, the performance of the proposed SSFC is investigated using different metrics such as analysis time, analyzed rate, dissemination delay, uncertain controls, and accuracy. From the investigation, it is seen that the proposed SSFC achieves 13.2% analysis time, 6.27% high analyzed rate, 18.15% less dissemination delay, 22.04% uncertain control, and 7.17% accuracy.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

These risk factors were analyzed and selected using stepwise regression and the variance inflation factor to eliminate the possibility of multicollinearity. To build efficient and informative prediction models of lung cancer incidence rates, several machine learning algorithms with cross-validation were adopted, namely, linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and cubist model tree. A case study in Taiwan showed that the cubist model tree with feature selection was the best model with an RMSE of 3.310 and an R-squared of 0.960. Through these predictive models, we also found that apart from smoking, the average NO2 concentration, employment percentage, and number of factories were also important factors that had significant impacts on the incidence of lung cancer. In addition, the random forest model without feature selection and with feature selection could support the interpretation of the most contributing variables. The predictive model proposed in the present study can help to precisely analyze and estimate lung cancer incidence rates so that effective preventative measures can be developed. Furthermore, the risk factors involved in the predictive model can help with the future analysis of lung cancer incidence rates from a holistic perspective. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Environmental monitoring of delicate ecosystems or pristine sites is critical to their preservation. The communication infrastructure for such monitoring should have as little impact on the natural ecosystem as possible. Because of their wide range capabilities and independence from heavy infrastructure, low-power wide area network protocols have recently been used in remote monitoring. In this regard, we propose a mobile vehicle-mounted gateway architecture for IoT data collection in communication-network-free areas. The limits of reliable communication are investigated in terms of gateway speed, throughput, and energy consumption. We investigate the performance of various gateway arrival scenarios, focusing on the trade-off between freshness of data, data collection rate, and end-node power consumption. Then we validate our findings using both real-world experiments and simulations. In addition, we present a case study exploiting the proposed architecture to provide coverage for Wadi El-Gemal national park in Egypt. The results show that reliable communication is achieved over all spreading factors ((Formula presented.)) for gateway speeds up to 150 km/h with negligible performance degradation at (Formula presented.) at speeds more than 100 km/h. The synchronized transmission model ensures the best performance in terms of throughput and power consumption at the expense of the freshness of data. Nonsynchronized transmission allows time-flexible data collection at the expense of increased power consumption. The same throughput as semisynchronized transmission is achieved using four gateways at only five times the energy consumption, while a single gateway requires seventeen times the amount of energy. Furthermore, increasing the number of gateways to ten increases the throughput to the level achieved by the synchronized scenario while consuming eight times the energy. © 2023 by the authors.},

Overall, wheeled robots have play a crucial role in the development of new monitoring techniques, mainly due to their capabilities (their movements can resemble the ones of a tractor) or because of the wide variety found on the market. Nevertheless, another kind of mobile robots, known as legged robots, have not been explored yet in the agricultural context, specifically as platforms for data gathering and eventually, for interaction with the growing. In this work, we compare the capabilities of a legged robot against a wheeled one following previously published guidelines for performance evaluation of both kind of robots. In particular, we evaluate the odometry responses and the energy consumption of the robots when performing previously known manoeuvres. Moreover, considering that in the agricultural context is feasible to find different kind of terrains, we performed our evaluation under grass, gravel and pavement, both even and uneven terrains, for a circle-shaped, closed S-shaped and square-shaped, of different sizes. Overall, the legged robot showed a more uniform response in the power consumption behaviour despite the kind of terrain, but the wheeled robot showed better results from a localization perspective. The analysis provided herein serve as the basis for future usage of legged robots in the agricultural context. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the economy and society, the low efficiency and high loss of the traditional power grid can no longer meet the growing social demand, and the power grid market is facing a reform. Smart grid, as a next-generation power system, it can effectively improve the performance of traditional power grids. The ubiquitous power Internet of Things (UPIOT) replaces the traditional grids with efficient, safe, reliable, and flexible new grids, improves the utilization efficiency of the grid, reduces the loss of the power grid in the transmission process, and can meet the needs of different types of markets and users. As an advanced information acquisition and processing technology, wireless sensor networks have been widely used in medical, industrial, agricultural, commercial, and public management fields. It is an important means to promote future economic development and build a harmonious society. In the power system, wireless sensor network technology can be widely used in many fields such as line fault location, real-time monitoring, smart meter reading, and relay protection. In this paper, the basic concepts and overall architecture of ubiquitous power Internet of Things are summarized. Then, we summarize the research status of the wireless sensor network in smart grid, including power equipment, line monitoring, smart grid wireless automatic meter reading, distribution network relay protection, power assets life-cycle management, power grid fault location, and power grid fault diagnosis. In view of the technical characteristics of wireless sensor networks, combined with the production links of power systems, the application framework of wireless sensor network technology in the power systems is constructed.

	abstract = {The importance of energy security for the successful functioning of private companies, national economies, and the overall society cannot be underestimated. Energy is a critical infrastructure for any modern society, and its reliable functioning is essential for all economic sectors and for the well-being of everybody. Uncertainty in terms of the availability of information, namely reliable data to make predictions and to plan for investment as well as for other actions of stakeholders in the energy markets is one of the factors with the highest influence on energy security. This uncertainty can be connected with many factors, such as the availability of reliable data or actions of stakeholders themselves. For example, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed negative impacts of uncertainty on decision-making processes and markets. At the time point when the market participants started to receive real-time information about the situation, the energy markets began to ease. This is one scenario where Big Data can be used to amplify information to various stakeholders to prevent panic and to ensure market stability and security of supply. Considering the novelty of this topic, our methodology is based on the meta-analysis of existing studies in the area of impacts of energy security on private companies, the national economy, and society. The results show that, in a fast-paced digital world characterized by technological advances, the use of Big Data technology provides a unique niche point to close this gap in information disparity by levering the use of unconventional data sources to integrate technologies, stakeholders, and markets to promote energy security and market stability. The potential of Big Data technology is yet to be fully utilized. Big Data can handle large data sets characterized by volume, variety, velocity, value, and complexity. Our conclusion is that the challenge for energy markets is to leverage this technology to mine available socioeconomic, political, geographic, and environmental data responsibly and to provide indicators that predict future global supply and demand. This information is crucial for energy security and ensuring global economic prosperity. © 2021 by the authors.},

In order to reveal the vibration characteristics of rice threshing drum under different working conditions and the vibration response state of the drum bearing undergoing different faults occur, the vibration system model of the threshing drum is established in this paper. With the help of the vibration test bench of the multi-stage threshing drum, the vibration signal test of the slippage and blockage of the threshing drum under the belt drive mode is carried out.

	abstract = {Research on the poverty risk caused by geological disasters in disaster-prone areas is a useful exploration to coordinate social economic development with disaster prevention and reduction, and is of great significance to the regional sustainable development. Based on statistical data and spatial data, this paper takes Sichuan Province as the typical research area. Remote sensing and geographic information technology are used to study the poverty risk caused by disasters based on the quantitative evaluation of geological disasters risk and regional development level. The spatial differentiation characteristics of poverty risk caused by disasters are explored on the 1 km × 1 km grid scale. The results indicate that (1) the overall risk of geological disasters in Sichuan Province is relatively high, with high and relatively high risk areas accounting for more than 40% and low and relatively low risk areas accounting for less than 30%. The risks in Mountain and Ravine Areas are significantly higher than other areas. (2) The regional development level in Sichuan Province is relatively high, but with significant spatial differences. The development level of high-altitude areas and remote mountainous areas is quite different from that of the Chengdu Plain in the middle Sichuan Province. The uneven development in the east, middle, and west is a prominent problem. (3) The poverty risk caused by disasters is high, and the spatial pattern presents a characteristic of “high in the west and low in the east” with high positive spatial correlation. High-High Cluster Areas are mainly distributed in western and southwestern Sichuan. Low-Low Outlier Areas are mainly distributed in Chengdu Plain and Hilly Areas of Sichuan Basin. High-Low Outlier and Low–High Outlier Areas occupy a relatively small percentage with scattered distribution.

	abstract = {On the basis of the panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020, this paper first constructs an index system through the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model and conducts a comprehensive evaluation of China’s agricultural environment according to the entropy weight TOPSIS model. Second, a coupling coordination degree model is established to calculate the degree of coupling coordination between the agricultural economy and the environment in each province. Finally, a spatial Durbin model is established to analyze the influencing factors of China’s agricultural economy. Results show that: ① the overall environment in the eastern region has little change, and the overall level is relatively backward; the agricultural environment in the central region is uneven; the agricultural environment in the western region is quite different from north to south. ② The regions with a high level of coupling coordination are mainly concentrated in the central and southern regions, and the performance is relatively intensive. The agricultural economy and the environment in the western region are extremely uncoordinated, and as is the overall coupling coordination between the agricultural economy and the environment in the eastern region in general. Further improvement is also needed. ③ Fixed asset investment, total power of agricultural machinery, rural electricity consumption, rural population, and rural per capita disposable income all have important influences on China’s agricultural economy. ④ The rural population size has a positive and the largest effect on the agricultural economy, whereas rural per capita disposable income has a negative effect on the agricultural economy. Moreover, improving farmers’ enthusiasm for farming is one of the key issues to be solved urgently. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Intensive research on energy-harvested sensor nodes has been driven by the challenges in achieving stringent design goals of battery lifetime, information accuracy, transmission distance, and cost. This challenge is further amplified by the inherent power-intensive nature of long-range communication when sensor networks are required to span vast areas, such as agricultural fields and remote terrain. Solar power is a common energy source in wireless sensor nodes, however, it is not reliable due to fluctuations in available power stemming from the changing seasons and weather conditions. This article tackles these issues by presenting a perpetually powered, energy-harvesting sensor node which utilizes a minimally sized solar cell and is capable of long-range communication by dynamically co-optimizing energy consumption and information transfer, termed as energy-information dynamic co-optimization (EICO). This energy-information intelligence is achieved by adaptive dutycycling of information transfer based on the total amount of energy available from the harvester and charge storage element to optimize the energy consumption of the sensor node, while employing in-sensor analytics (ISA) to minimize loss of information. This is the first reported sensor node < 35 cm2 in dimension, which is capable of long-range communication over >1 km at continuous information transfer rates of up to 1 packet/second which is enabled by EICO and ISA.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: Low precipitation and soil erosion are critical threats to sustainable agricultural development in the north-western coastal zone of Egypt. Conservation tillage may offer a good opportunity to mitigate these threats; however, switching from traditional tillage to conservation tillage causes initial challenges such as soil compaction and erosion. Aims: This study was designed in order to assess the effects of various tillage practices on soil bulk density, volumetric water content, runoff rate, runoff initiation time, soil loss, sediment yield rate and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in a cultivated basin area. Furthermore, to investigate the efficacy of various rainfall intensities in generating runoff in a micro-catchment area. Methods: Under rainfall simulation, five rainfall intensities (14, 21, 30, 36, and 45 mm h-1) and three tillage practices (contour tillage, CT; traditional tillage, TT; and no tillage, NT) were investigated. Key results: Under various rainfall intensities, the CT treatment significantly reduced surface runoff compared with the TT and NT treatments. For the 30 mm h-1 rainfall intensity, the CT treatment decreased sediment yield rate by 58.7% and 49.4% compared with NT and TT treatments, respectively. Furthermore, the CT treatment significantly increased precipitation use efficiency by 11.8% and 19.9% compared with TT and NT treatments, respectively. Additionally, the CT increased grain yield by 12.3% more than TT and 21% more than NT. Conclusions and implications: Consequently, it is preferable to encourage farmers to use CT practices when transitioning from traditional tillage to conservation tillage. Moreover, soil compaction and smoothing may contribute to enhance the generated runoff on the micro-catchment area.  © 2022 Soil Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The sugarcane plantations in China occupy large areas of undulated terrain. During the operation of a sugarcane harvester, the operator's vision is severely obstructed, and the height of the cutter needs to be adjusted frequently, resulting in low sugarcane harvesting efficiency and difficulty in ensuring harvesting quality. However, the current diversified non-contact methods are unable to distinguish or penetrate the interference well to provide feedback regarding the change in terrain height. Based on the proposed contact sensing method, a contact terrain sensing device is designed for application to the sugarcane harvester, and the orthogonal test is carried out with the standard orthogonal table L9(34) to study the influence of the working parameters of the device on the terrain height sensing performance. Through the analysis of the working principle of the device, three factors (moving speed, rotational torque, and preload) are tested in three levels, and index systems of the Fréchet distance and residual standard deviation are proposed. The range and variance analysis methods are used to statistically analyze the test results to determine the primary and secondary orders of operation parameters. Then, the regression model was obtained by regression analysis on the influencing factors. After analysis, the influences of moving speed and rotating torque were found to be the most significant, and the influence of preload was the smallest. The results show that the average relative errors between the experimental values and predicted model values of the Fréchet distance and residual standard deviation were 3.46% and 2.48%. According to the practical applications of the sugarcane harvester and the data of the two indexes, the optimal value ranges of moving speed (km/h) and rotating torque (Nm) are determined as (1.57, 1.75) and (0.73, 0.86), respectively, which provide a certain reference for the subsequent application of the terrain sensing device to sugarcane harvesters. © 2022 Liang Zhao et al.},

The drone industry has been getting significant attention as a model of manufacturing, service and delivery convergence, introducing synergy with the coexistence of different emerging domains. UAVs offer implicit peculiarities such as increased airborne time and payload capabilities, swift mobility, and access to remote and disaster areas. Despite these potential features, including extensive variety of usage, high maneuverability, and cost-efficiency, drones are still limited in terms of battery endurance, flight autonomy and constrained flight time to perform persistent missions. Other critical concerns are battery endurance and the weight of drones, which must be kept low. Intuitively it is not suggested to load them with heavy batteries. This study highlights the importance of drones, goals and functionality problems. In this review, a comprehensive study on UAVs, swarms, types, classification, charging, and standardization is presented. In particular, UAV applications, challenges, and security issues are explored in the light of recent research studies and development.

	abstract = {The current optimization approaches of construction machinery are mainly based on internal sensors. However, the decision of a reasonable strategy is not only determined by its intrinsic signals, but also very strongly by environmental information, especially the terrain. Due to the dynamic changing of the construction site and the consequent absence of a high definition map, the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) offering the terrain information for construction machines is still challenging. Current SLAM technologies proposed for mobile machines are strongly dependent on costly or computationally expensive sensors, such as RTK GPS and cameras, so that commercial use is rare. In this study, we proposed an affordable SLAM method to create a multi-layer grid map for the construction site so that the machine can have the environmental information and be optimized accordingly. Concretely, after the machine passes by the grid, we can obtain the local information and record it. Combining with positioning technology, we then create a map of the interesting places of the construction site. As a result of our research gathered from Gazebo, we showed that a suitable layout is the combination of one IMU and two differential GPS antennas using the unscented Kalman filter, which keeps the average distance error lower than 2m and the mapping error lower than 1.3% in the harsh environment. As an outlook, our SLAM technology provides the cornerstone to activate many efficiency improvement approaches. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Identifying the in-field trajectories of harvests is important for the activity analysis of agricultural machinery. This paper presents a K-means-based trajectory identification method that can automatically detect the “turning”, “working”, and “abnormal working” trajectories for wheat harvester in-field operation scenarios. This method contains two stages: clustering and correction. The clustering stage performs by the two-step K-means iterative clustering method (D-K-means). In the correction stage, the first step (M1) is performed based on the three distance features between the trajectory segments and the cluster center of the trajectory segments. The second step (M2) is based on the direction change of the “turning” and “abnormal working” trajectories. The third correction step (M3) is based on the operating characteristics to specify the start and stop positions of the turning. The developed method was validated by 50 trajectories. The results for the three trajectories and the five time intervals from 1 s to 5 s both have f1-scores above 0.90, and the f1-score using only the clustering method and the method of this paper increased from 0.55 to 0.95. After removing the turning and abnormal operation trajectories, the error of calculating farmland area with distance algorithm is reduced by 17.04% compared with that before processing. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 is rampaging the world, increasing medical emergencies, imposing a high cost on every Nation’s expenditure without minding the budget, and causing a continuous rise in the death rate. It has come to stay and live with people in the world. The cure is no longer the case, but how to manage it is now the fact. It is essential to save time, cost of running tests and test kits, cost of purchasing vaccine, create awareness in public places, decongest the isolation centers, save time to get test results, and provide mobility advantage for testing people anywhere and everywhere. This model will quickly detect and report COVID-19 symptoms on patients with cost-effectiveness to bring down the rising curve. It presents an Internet of Things (IOT) based COVID-19 detector that lowers the cost of testing by using machine learning techniques for easy and timely detection of Covid-19 symptoms in a patient. The device integrates an Infrared (IR) camera, Infrared skin thermometer, IR stethoscope, IR sphygmomanometer for blood pressure, a liquid crystal display screen to show the result, a Buzz alarm and its database, hosted in the cloud and connected via the wireless network. The training and test data gives an accuracy of 0.995 and 0.996, respectively, by using the k-nearest neighbor’s classifier. It shows that the model performs well on training and test data without overfitting. Nine patients were further tested with the model, four were reported positive by this model, five returned negative, and the maximum time taken to complete the check was 28 s, while the minimum time was 20.5 s, which shows that the device is time-efficient and can be used where large numbers of people are expected. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Field-road segmentation is one of the key tasks in the processing of the trajectory of agricultural machinery. To improve the accuracy of the field-road segmentation, this study proposed an XGBoost model based on dual feature extraction and recursive feature elimination called DR-XGBoost. DR-XGBoost takes only a small amount of agricultural machine trajectory features as input. Firstly, the model adopted the dual feature extraction method we designed to rapidly expand the number of features and then adequately extract local trajectory features by the time window and feature extraction operator. Secondly, the model applies the recursive feature elimination algorithm to eliminate redundant features from the perspective of the model segmentation effect and thus reduce the computational consumption of model training. Thirdly, it trains XGBoost to complete the trajectory segmentation. To evaluate the effectiveness of DR-XGBoost, we conducted a series of experiments on a real trajectory dataset of agricultural machines. The model achieves a 98.2% Macro-F1 score on the dataset, which is 10.9% higher than the previous state-of-art. The proposal of DR-XGBoost fills the knowledge gap of trajectory feature extraction for agricultural machinery and provides a reasonable and effective feature selection scheme for the field-road segmentation problem. © 2023, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Microwave heating is a promising solution to overcome the shortcomings of conventional heating in biomass pyrolysis. Nevertheless, biomass microwave pyrolysis is a complex thermochemical process governed by several endogenous and exogenous parameters. Modeling such a complicated process is challenging due to the need for many experimental measurements. Machine learning can effectively cope with the time and cost constraints of experiments. Hence, this study uses machine learning to model the quantity and quality of products (biochar, bio-oil, and syngas) that evolve in biomass microwave pyrolysis. An inclusive dataset encompassing different biomass types, microwave absorbers, and reaction conditions is selected from the literature and subjected to data mining. Three machine learning models (support vector regressor, random forest regressor, and gradient boost regressor) are used to model the process based on 14 descriptors. The gradient boost regressor model provides better prediction performance (R2 > 0.822, RMSE <12.38, and RRMSE <0.765) than the other models. SHAP analysis generally reveals the significance of operating temperature, microwave power, and reaction time in predicting the output responses. Overall, the developed machine learning model can effectively save cost and time during biomass microwave pyrolysis while serving as a valuable tool for guiding experiments and facilitating optimization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The main impetus for the global efforts toward the current digital transformation in almost all areas of our daily lives is due to the great successes of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular, the workhorse of AI, statistical machine learning (ML). The intelligent analysis, modeling, and management of agricultural and forest ecosystems, and of the use and protection of soils, already play important roles in securing our planet for future generations and will become irreplaceable in the future. Technical solutions must encompass the entire agricultural and forestry value chain. The process of digital transformation is supported by cyber-physical systems enabled by advances in ML, the availability of big data and increasing computing power. For certain tasks, algorithms today achieve performances that exceed human levels. The challenge is to use multimodal information fusion, i.e., to integrate data from different sources (sensor data, images, *omics), and explain to an expert why a certain result was achieved. However, ML models often react to even small changes, and disturbances can have dramatic effects on their results. Therefore, the use of AI in areas that matter to human life (agriculture, forestry, climate, health, etc.) has led to an increased need for trustworthy AI with two main components: explainability and robustness. One step toward making AI more robust is to leverage expert knowledge. For example, a farmer/forester in the loop can often bring in experience and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline—no AI can do this. Consequently, human-centered AI (HCAI) is a combination of “artificial intelligence” and “natural intelligence” to empower, amplify, and augment human performance, rather than replace people. To achieve practical success of HCAI in agriculture and forestry, this article identifies three important frontier research areas: (1) intelligent information fusion; (2) robotics and embodied intelligence; and (3) augmentation, explanation, and verification for trusted decision support. This goal will also require an agile, human-centered design approach for three generations (G). G1: Enabling easily realizable applications through immediate deployment of existing technology.

However, due to the infancy in research and the stringent requirements of the state-of-the-art, spectral and energy-efficiency (EE) issues remain a prime challenge. Recently, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), consisting of arbitrarily allocated access points (APs) linked to a central processing unit (CPU), has been in the limelight, particularly because of its distinctive benefits toward achieving optimal EE and spectral gains. This chapter provides a comprehensive discussion on the feasibility as well as the effectiveness of CF-mMIMO in providing an improved spectral and energy-efficient UAV cellular network. First, an exposition into the evolution from the classical cell-based structure to the novel CF structure is presented. Next, elaborate discussions on the system model, propagation model, channel estimation, and communication process of UAV-aided CF-mMIMO networks are provided. Further, novel expressions for the achievable lower and upper spectral efficiency (SE) bounds for UL and DL data transmission phases are derived. Finally, analytical and numerical results derived through intensive computer simulations and open research issues are presented to inform future research directions toward achieving reliable UAV communications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Global Navigation Satellite System with Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) dual-antenna sensor is used to measure acceleration, speed, and vehicle position to determine the turning radius and determine the proper formula to calculate long average lateral acceleration acting on vehicle and cargo. The two methods for automatic selection of events were applied based on stable lateral acceleration value and on mean square error (MSE) of turning radiuses. The models of calculation of turning radius are valid for turning radius within 5–70 m for both methods of automatic selection of events with mean root mean square error (RMSE) 1.88 m and 1.32 m. The models of calculation of lateral acceleration are valid with mean RMSE of 0.022 g and 0.016 g for both methods of automatic selection of events. The results of the paper may be applied in the planning and implementation of packing and cargo securing procedures to calculate average lateral acceleration acting on vehicle and cargo based on turning radius and speed for vehicles up to 3.5 t GVM.

	abstract = {The applications of digital agriculture technologies are increasing rapidly with increased interest from the new generation of farmers to use digital solutions. Such technologies include several in-field and remote sensors besides data processing software packages. The accumulation of archived data from season to season has become an issue considering the high spatial and temporal resolution of the generated data from the commercially available sensors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the accumulated data considering the evolution of utilized digital solutions from a farmer's case study. This study estimated the data storage disc space requirements in the last two decades from a 22 ha field located in North Italy. The farmer's accumulated data sources were from an in-field weather station, soil analysis information, soil apparent electrical conductivity scanning, soil moisture sensor, planter performance monitoring system, yield maps, Sentinel-2 satellite images, and recently drone images. The accumulated data were reported on an annual basis with respect to each year's specific contribution. The results showed that the total accumulated data size from the study field reached 18.6 GB in 2020 mainly due to the use of drone images with a predicted total data size of 40.5 GB by 2025. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An active heating system is often necessary for the normal growth of crops in a greenhouse, particularly with the severe winter weather in northern China. Among them, an air-source heat pump system can be favored for the low energy consumption, cost saving, and less pollution. Much effort was mostly on the working performance of heat pumps. Specifically, an advanced control systems of greenhouse environment with a high level of automation cannot better fit the current situation of family-oriented greenhouse cultivation, particularly at a high cost. It is highly urgent to combine the temperature control systems for the regulation of the greenhouse with the air source heat pump in a reasonable and simple way. In this study, an intelligent monitoring system was established to combine the management needs of modern greenhouse using the typical IoT structure. The system also consisted of on-site monitoring subsystem, IoT cloud box, and remote monitoring subsystem. The integrated heat transfer coefficient was then calculated under the rolled/unrolled greenhouse, according to the basic principles of heat transfer. The measured data was utilized to determine the performance parameters of the air source heat pump heating system and fogging spray. The heat balance equation was selected to establish the relationship equation between the control time of regulating equipment and environmental parameters of greenhouse. As such, the temperature control strategy was designed to collect the environmental data in real time by sensors. The obtained data was set as the input in the process, while the output was required the working time of equipment to control the equipment start and stop, according to the time to regulate the greenhouse temperature. At the same time, the crop light compensation point was used to control the action of the rolled quilt, in order to fully meet the light environment that required for the crop growth. An outdoor light irradiance was also used to correct the indoor light irradiance, because the sensor value cannot accurately reflect the real value, due to the rolled quilt before the unrolling action. Once the indoor irradiance correction value was greater than the crop light compensation point, the volume was opened, otherwise, the volume was closed. A series of experiments were also carried out with the greenhouse cucumber cultivation. There were the stable changes and small fluctuations of temperature around the target value in the improved model under the heat balance equation. The single-day power consumption of the control system saved 9.06 kW·h under similar external weather conditions, compared with the set value-based control system, accounting for 10.95% of the power consumption on the test day. Consequently, the control system under the heat balance equation can be easily implemented to regulate via the different temperature target values, according to the crop demand. The finding can provide a strong reference for the application and promotion of temperature control strategy for the greenhouse in winter. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Arable land ecosystems are among the most important terrestrial systems. The issues of carbon sequestration and emission reductions in arable land ecosystems have received extensive attention. Countries around the world have actively issued policies to manage arable land ecosystems. At present, more than 100 countries have made carbon neutralization target commitments. Various arable land management measures and arable land planting strategies have important impacts on the carbon storage of arable land ecosystems. Research on arable land carbon is of great significance to global climate change. This study attempts to investigate the problems and deficiencies in the current research by summarizing a number of studies, including the main methods for the quantitative research of carbon sources and sinks as well as the influencing factors in these ecosystems. In this study, it is found that due to the differences of climate patterns, soil properties and management practices in arable land ecosystems, the factors affecting carbon sources and sinks are of great heterogeneity and complexity. Generally, variations in natural factors affect the carbon balance in different regions, while human management measures, such as irrigation, fertilization and the degree of agricultural mechanization, are the leading factors causing changes to carbon sources and sinks in these ecosystems. In addition, there are still great uncertainties in the evaluation of carbon sources and sinks in these ecosystems caused by different estimation models and methods. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on model parameter acquisition and method optimization in the future. This review provides a scientific basis for understanding carbon sources and sinks in arable land ecosystems, enhancing their carbon sink capacity and guiding low-carbon agriculture on arable land. © 2022 by the authors.

Thereafter, a joint energy resource allocation framework is proposed to minimize the required number of photovoltaic (PV) panels and batteries. To solve the joint energy resource allocation problem, we divide it into two sub-problems, minimum PV panel allocation for a fixed number of batteries and minimum battery allocation for a fixed number of PV panels. The two sub-problems are further solved using the proposed MinBatAlloc and MinPVAlloc algorithms. Moreover, we introduce a system parameter α, that signifies the ratio between solar power supplied to operate ONU-AP and to charge the batteries. The results are shown by varying α and its impact on the energy resource allocation and battery lifetime. We compare the performance of our proposed approach with non-ML based approaches, such as, maximum, minimum, median, and outage threshold based energy resource allocation. Through the obtained results it has been shown that the proposed approach considerably improves the performance in terms of outage, lifetime, carbon dioxide emissions, and cost.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Home to over 80 percent of all life on Earth, the ocean is the world’s largest carbon sink and a key source of food and economic security for billions of people. The relevance of the ocean for humanity's future is undisputed. However, the ocean’s great potential to drive economic growth and equitable job creation, sustain healthy ecosystems, and mitigate climate change is not yet fully recognised. Lack of awareness of this potential as well as management and governance challenges pose impediments. Until these impediments are removed, ocean ecosystems will continue to be degraded and opportunities for people lost. A transition and a clear path to a thriving and vibrant relationship between humans and the ocean are urgently needed. This open access collection of papers and reports identifies a path that is inspired by science, energised by engaged people, and emboldened by visionary leaders. These assessments of knowledge are commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel), which was established in September 2018 as a unique initiative led by heads of state and government from around the world, to showcase the latest leading-edge science, knowledge and state-of-the-art thinking on key ocean issues. Altogether, The Blue Compendium offers innovative ocean solutions in technology, policy, governance, and finance realms, that could help accelerate a transition to a more sustainable and prosperous relationship with the ocean. The comprehensive assessments have already informed policy making at the highest levels of government and motivated an impressive array of responsive and ambitious action across a growing network of leaders in business, finance and civil society. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

In order to perform an agricultural task, the mobile robot goes through a sequence of sub operations and integration of hardware and software systems. Starting with localization, an agricultural robot uses sensor systems to estimate its current position and orientation in field, employs algorithms to find optimal paths and reach target positions. It then uses techniques and models to perform feature recognition and finally executes the agricultural task through an end effector. This article, compiled through scrutinizing the current literature, is a step-by-step approach of the strategies and ways these sub-operations are performed and integrated together.

	abstract = {In this study, an advanced transport flux method based on the comprehensive stereoscopic observation verification was used to evaluate the contribution of transport to pollution in the North China Plain (NCP) and Sichuan Basin (SCB). The simulations were verified using fixed-point lidar and satellite observations, and the results demonstrated that the modeling flux calculation method was suitable for investigating the evolutionary trend of PM2.5 flux. The monthly inflow, outflow, and net flux indicated the intensive interactions and significant temporal and spatial variations of PM2.5 transport though the boundary segment of the city and region. In both autumn and winter, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region always played the role of “source” region, while Cheng-Yu (CY) region principally acted as a “convergence” region. In autumn and winter, the BTH region was controlled by a cold front weather system, and the pollutants were readily transported to the surrounding areas. However, the CY region was affected by the complex terrain, with small wind speeds near the ground and poor horizontal diffusion. The upper air was controlled by the northwestern winds behind the trough, and the air subsidence is substantial. The combined action of horizontal and vertical wind directions caused the accumulation of pollutants in the basin. Notably, one intrinsic transport pathway during two representative months was identified based on the investigation of cross-city and cross-region transport, namely the southwest–northeast (SW–NE) pathway in the BTH region. In the CY region, the northeastern transport pathway greatly influenced the cities in the basin. Additionally, through the analysis of the typical heavy pollution processes in the two regions, it was found that the southwest pathway of the BTH region and northeast pathway of the CY region in inter-city transport were significant factors before reaching the most severe stage of pollution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Conventional extensive irrigation of paddy fields has posed a great challenge on crop growth, natural rainfall, and water resources. It is highly demanding for networked intelligent irrigation systems, with the increase in the area of paddy fields during agricultural modernization. However, the current irrigation system is still lacking in the deployment flexibility of underlying equipment, connectivity, and energy consumption of communication networks, as well as the intelligence decision-making of the whole system. Particularly, the energy consumption of equipment inevitably impacts the serving life of the equipment. In addition, the wired information transmission is used in most irrigation systems, where a large number of cables need to be erected. As such, great difficulties have been brought to the deployment and maintenance of equipment, due mainly to the complex environment in paddy fields. In this study, a precision irrigation strategy was proposed to fully utilize the natural precipitation using the sensor, embedded system, wireless networking, and artificial intelligence. Firstly, a networked precision irrigation system was designed for paddy fields using smart agricultural technology. Specifically, five modules were included: data collection node, irrigation control node, handheld control terminal, PC control terminal, and intelligent communication node. The wireless communication was used to flexibly deploy in the paddy fields with the solar power generation devices. Secondly, the fuzzy control was utilized to establish some of the models, including the most optimal deployment model of communication nodes, the most optimal irrigation decision-making model, a prediction model of crop water consumption and precipitation, as well as a decision-making system of precision irrigation. The design strategy was adopted in the decision-making system using the MATLAB+LABVIEW platform, in order to control the system by mutual cooperation. A new deployment model was proposed to optimize the deployment of communication nodes in the irrigation using the improved moth flame optimization and the Voronoi diagram, thereby improving the communication efficiency of the irrigation network, while reducing the energy consumption of communication. As such, the status and network meteorological parameters in the paddy fields were used as the input of the precision irrigation decision-making system. Finally, the irrigation equipment of the paddy field was adaptively controlled for precision irrigation after the decision-making of the system. Taking the rice fields in Jiangsu, China as an example, a field test was carried out to compare with the simulation. It was found that the intelligent irrigation system reduced the action frequency of irrigation equipment by 26.67%, while the irrigation volume of the system reduced by 40.82%, and the drainage volume reduced by 33.89%, compared with the traditional. Consequently, the operating life of the equipment was improved significantly, while the waste of water resources was reduced under the optimal growth water level of paddy field crops. The hardware and software parts of the system also performed well to meet the requirements of design indicators. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {This article presents the current state-of-the-art research on applying artificial intelligence (AI) technology in smart greenhouses to optimize crop yields, water, and fertilizer use efficiency, to reduce pest and disease, and to enhance agricultural sustainability. The key technologies of interest were robotic systems for pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting, bio-inspired algorithms for the automation of greenhouse processes, energy management, machine path planning and operation of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), resolution of scheduling problems, and image signal processing for pest and disease diagnosis. Additionally, the review investigated the cost benefits of various energy-management and AI-based energy-saving technologies, the integration of photovoltaics and dynamic pricing based on real-time and time-of-use metrics, and the cost benefits of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and RFID (radiofrequency identification) technologies. The review established that commercially viable AI technologies for agriculture had increased exponentially. For example, AI-based irrigation and soil fertilizer application enabled farmers to realize higher returns on investment on fertilizer application and gross returns above the fertilizer cost, higher yields, and resource use efficiency. Similarly, AI image detection techniques led to the early diagnosis of powdery mildew. The precise operation of agricultural robots was supported by the integration of light imaging, detection, and ranging (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras in place of the traditional GPS (geographic positioning systems) technologies, which are prone to errors. However, critical challenges remained unresolved, including cost, disparities between research and development (R&D) innovations and technology commercialization, energy use, the tradeoff between accuracy and computational speeds, and technology gaps between the Global North and South. In general, the value of this review is that it surveys the literature on the maturity level of various AI technologies in smart greenhouses and offers a state-of-the-art picture of how far the technologies have successfully been applied in agriculture and what can be done to optimize their usability. © 2022 by the author.},

In this study, Landsat image based greenhouse maps in Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi, China were made using random forest classification algorithm through visual interpretation on the Google Earth Engine. The 7-year's changes in greenhouse areas were investigated (i.e. 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2019) with yearly overall accuracy more than 90%. The results showed that the total area of greenhouses in Guanzhong Plain demonstrated an increasing trend, from 5.92 km2 in 2000 to 194.42 km2 in 2019 with a considerable growth between 2010 and 2015. The dominant drivers for the increase are largely attributed to the government policy as well as economic profitability. The distribution of greenhouse shifts to central and eastern regions of Guanzhong Plain. Greenhouses preferentially expand to the area near to rural roads, main rivers, and high elevation, with more than 45% greenhouses distributed within 1 km of the county rural road. The principal component analysis based suitability evaluation showed that a total of 38.44% of the area was suitable for greenhouse. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The escalation in carbon dioxide concentration has precipitated global climate warming, accentuating ecological and environmental concerns. Notably, China stands as the world’s largest carbon emitter, with the Taihu Lake basin emerging as a carbon-intensive region within the country. This paper undertakes a comprehensive analysis spanning 2005 to 2020, calculating the economic contribution coefficient of carbon emissions and the ecological carrying coefficient of carbon absorption in the Taihu Lake basin. The study includes a delineation of carbon balance zones and an exploration of the geographical and spatial influences of both ecosystem and economic factors. The overarching trend in carbon emissions within the Taihu Lake Basin initially exhibited rapid growth, followed by a fluctuating decline, with the pivotal year being 2012, recording the apex of emissions at 575.8293 million tons. Concurrently, total carbon absorption demonstrated a fluctuating growth trajectory, ascending from 82.3503 million tons in 2005 to 85.6488 million tons in 2020. The carbon emission intensity in the basin manifested a pattern of high concentration in the northeast and low concentration in the southwest, while the carbon absorption intensity displayed the inverse pattern. The carbon balance across the Taihu Lake Basin revealed a spatial incongruity, characterized by a suboptimal pattern in the northeast and a favorable pattern in the southwest. Zhejiang Province emerged as an ecological stronghold within the basin, acting as the primary carbon sink functional area. Urban built-up areas and forested regions emerged as principal influencers of carbon balance in the Taihu Lake basin. Urban construction land, population density, and arable land area were identified as primary contributors to carbon emissions, whereas per capita GDP, forests, grasslands, and water bodies were identified as main contributors to carbon absorption in the watershed.

Applications that involve PA techniques in coffee production are defined now as Precision Coffee growing (PC). Systematically explored, studies on the subject contribute to improvements in the area, relating soil variability to its impacts on plants. The PC’s scientific approach offers new forms of management and more security in coffee production. Aimed at reducing pesticides application and nutrients to the soil, contributing to sustainable development in coffee production. Initially, the research on coffee production had dealt with soil spatial variability, highlighting the geostatistical methods and specific ways to sample the soil. With technological advances in agriculture, new ways of monitoring spatial variability are available. In this context, studies are arising on spatial variability related to the plant, applying terrestrial, aerial and orbital sensors, possibly creating perspectives for monitoring and mapping coffee production. Artificial intelligence, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (ARP) products, harvesting yield sensors, automatic grain classifiers, and remote sensing stand out as new technologies under development in coffee production.

	abstract = {IoT based smart agriculture systems are important for efficient usage of lands, water, and energy resources. Wireless communication protocols constitute a critical part of smart agriculture systems because the fields, in general, cover a large area requiring system components to be placed at distant locations. There are various communication protocols with different features that can be utilized in smart agriculture applications. When designing a smart agriculture system, it is required to carefully consider the features of possible protocols to make a suitable and optimal selection. Therefore, this review paper aims to underline the specifications of the wireless communication protocols that are widely used in smart agriculture applications. Furthermore, application-specific requirements, which may be useful during the design stage of the smart agriculture systems, are highlighted. To accomplish these aims, this paper compares the technical properties and investigates the practical applications of five different wireless communication protocols that are commonly used in IoT applications: ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN. In particular, the inconsistencies in the technical properties of these protocols reported in different resources have been highlighted and the reason for this situation has been discussed. Considering the features offered by the protocols and the requirements of smart agriculture applications, the appropriateness of a particular protocol to a particular smart agriculture application is examined. In addition, issues about cost, communication quality, and hardware of the five protocols have been mentioned. The trending technologies with high potential for the future applications of smart agriculture have been introduced. In this context, the relation of the technologies like aerial systems, cellular communication, and big data analytics with wireless have been specified. Finally, the leading protocol and the smart agriculture application area have been highlighted through observing the year-based distribution of the recent publications. It has been shown that usage of LoRaWAN protocol has become more widespread in recent years. © 2022},

A micro hydropower system is proposed to power the telemetry tag, which can significantly increase its electrical energy. The hydropower is derived from the seawater head difference between the dive and surfacing of the tagged animal and is renewed by repeated dives of the animal. The mathematical model of the power system is built, and the test system for validating the mathematical model is built and tested. Based on the validated mathematic model, the analysis is conducted to obtain the performance and of the power system under single dive of tagged animals. The analysis results show that the power system can reach the energy conversion efficiency of 28.2% when the animal dives to depth of 600 m. The energy efficiency is influenced slightly by the dive depth of animals. When the power system is applied in telemetry tags, the electrical energy that it provide can outperform total energy of original battery of the same size in only several months. The micro hydropower system provides a novel and high efficient way in the ultra-high head hydropower generation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Recent advances rely on computer vision systems that differentiate between crops, weeds, and soil. However, manual dataset capture and annotation is labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. Agricultural robots provide many benefits in effectively performing repetitive tasks faster and more accurately than humans, and despite the many advantages of using robots in agriculture, the solutions are still often expensive. In this work, we designed and built a low-cost autonomous robot (DARob) in order to facilitate image acquisition in agricultural fields. The total cost to build the robot was estimated to be around (Formula presented.). A low-cost robot to capture datasets in agriculture offers advantages such as affordability, efficiency, accuracy, security, and access to remote areas. Furthermore, we created a new dataset for the segmentation of plants and weeds in bean crops. In total, 228 RGB images with a resolution of 704 × 480 pixels were annotated containing 75.10% soil area, 17.30% crop area and 7.58% weed area.

Kasap finds that, as AVs are one of the most significant and profound technological advances of the 21st century, relying on machine learning and pattern recognition systems to function, the current liability regime surrounding them requires a rethinking. Critically analysing the tort liability of AVs, chapters deconstruct and reconstruct a tort law regime for AVs, ultimately solving how policymakers should approach the challenges faced in regulating and enacting AV legislation. Interdisciplinary in approach, it will prove invaluable to students and scholars of computer science and law, particularly those studying AI and robotics law, and those interested in the regulation and governance of AV technology. It also offers vital tools for policymakers seeking concrete principles on which to define potential laws and regulations for AV technology. © Atilla Kasap 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There are many accidents in road traffic involving both heavy goods vehicles and passenger vehicles, and the interpretation of the causes of some accidents can be very difficult. The paper presents the results of an analysis of the road accident causes involving a truck and two passenger cars. The hypothesis was verified that the incident took place after the damage to the front wheel of the truck, which resulted in an uncontrolled change of the direction of its travel and leaving the lane in the opposite direction of the passenger cars. The damaged tire was inspected, and traces were described in the form of cracks on the side surface, irregular abrasion on the central part of the side surface and near the bead, as well as deformations resulting from damage to the cord. The thesis was made that the tire cracked as a result of its material structure defects. In order to verify it, bench tests were carried out on the deformation of the tire sidewall at various load conditions, which simulated driving with too little air pressure in the tire. Detailed studies of the fracture of the tire sidewall and the wires that make up its steel cord were carried out. Macroscopic examination of the cord wires on eight samples revealed the presence of corrosion changes that should not occur under normal operating conditions. The results of the research work indicate that tire rupture was caused by delamination of the material coatings and corrosion of the steel cord wires. These defects could have arisen due to the earlier cracking of the rubber layer and the ingress of moisture or as a result of the use of corroded steel cord wires in tire production. In the analyzed case, the driver could not regain control of the vehicle and avoid a collision with oncoming vehicles. © 2022 by the authors.},

This review article focused on biomimetic innovations, including bio‐inspired soft robots and swarm robots that could serve multiple functions, including the harvesting of fruits, pest control, and crop management. The research demonstrated commercially available biomimetic innovations, including robot bees by Arugga AI Farming and the Robotriks Traction Unit (RTU) precision farming equipment. Additionally, soft robotic systems have made it possible to mitigate the risk of surface bruises, rupture, the crushing destruction of plant tissue, and plastic deformation in the harvesting of fruits with a soft rind such as apples, cherries, pears, stone fruits, kiwifruit, mandarins, cucumbers, peaches, and pome. Even though the smart farming technologies, which were developed to mimic nature, could help prevent climate change and enhance the intensification of agriculture, there are concerns about long‐term ecological impact, cost, and their inability to complement natural processes such as pollination. Despite the problems, the market for bio‐inspired technologies with potential agricultural applications to modernize farming and solve the above-mentioned challenges has increased exponentially. Future research and development should lead to low‐cost FEA robotic grippers and FEA‐tendon‐driven grippers for crop harvesting. In brief, soft robots and swarm robotics have immense potential in agriculture. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Soil degradation threatens agricultural production and soil multifunctionality. Efforts for private and public governance are increasingly emerging to leverage sustainable soil management. They require consensus across science, policy, and practice about what sustainable soil management entails. Such agreement does not yet exist to a sufficient extent in agronomic terms; what is lacking is a concise list of soil management measures that enjoy broad support among all stakeholders, and evidence on the question what hampers their implementation by farmers. We therefore screened stakeholder documents from public governance institutions, nongovernmental organizations, the agricultural industry, and conventional and organic farmer associations for recommendations related to agricultural soil management in Germany. Out of 46 recommended measures in total, we compiled a shortlist of the seven most consensual ones: (1) structural landscape elements, (2) organic fertilization, (3) diversified crop rotation, (4) permanent soil cover, (5) conservation tillage, (6) reduced soil loads, and (7) optimized timing of wheeling. Together, these measures support all agricultural soil functions, and address all major soil threats except soil contamination. Implementation barriers were identified with the aid of an online survey among farmers (n = 78). Results showed that a vast majority of farmers (> 80%) approved of all measures. Barriers were mostly considered to be economic and in some cases technological, while missing knowledge or other factors were less relevant. Barriers were stronger for those measures that cannot be implemented in isolation, but require a systemic diversification of the production system. This is especially the case for measures that are simultaneously beneficial to many soil functions (measures 2, 3, and 4). Results confirm the need for a diversification of the agricultural system in order to meet challenges of food security and climate change. The shortlist presents the first integrative compilation of sustainable soil management measures supporting the design of effective public or private governance. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Present networks (3G/4G), WiFi are in limited availability and bandwidth that cause delays in data transfer (latency) and hinder effective data transfer. But high-speed communication system, reliable and secured data connection is required for precision agriculture, cyber physical management systems and use of IoT in farm operations. Loss of data connection between devices, sensors or data servers’ impacts the precision and effectiveness of technology applied. High data transfer volumes and low latency data exchange were the major advantages of 5G technology, facilitates its use in precision farming and IoT applications in a most efficient way. It also enables the autonomous and robotic machinery for various operations in the aspects of agriculture and livestock production. The major application of 5G in mechanization is control systems for robotic harvesters, drones, autonomous vehicles, surveillance etc. Remote locations such as hill farms has the inherent constraints such as remoteness, marginality, slope etc., remains underutilized, can be developed with advanced communication systems.

From the invention of the first industrial robots in the 1950s, robots have begun to capture the attention of both research and industry. Thanks to the recent advancements in computer science, sensing, and control approaches, agricultural robots have experienced a rapid evolution, relying on various cutting-edge technologies for different application scenarios. Indeed, significant refinements have been achieved by integrating perception, decision-making, control, and execution techniques. However, most agricultural robots continue to require intelligence solutions, limiting them to small-scale applications without quantity production because of their lack of integration with artificial intelligence. Therefore, to help researchers and engineers grasp the prevalent research status of agricultural robots, in this review we refer to more than 100 pieces of literature according to the category of agricultural robots under discussion. In this context, we bring together diverse agricultural robot research statuses and applications and discuss the benefits and challenges involved in further applications.

	abstract = {Air pollution during the COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing and its surrounding regions has received substantial attention. We collected observational data, including air pollutant concentrations and meteorological parameters, during January and February from 2018 to 2021. A statistical and a numerical model were applied to identify the formation of air pollution and the impact of emission reduction on air quality. Relative humidity, wind speed, SO2, NO2, and O3 had nonlinear effects on the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, among which the effects of relative humidity, NO2, and O3 were prominent. During the 2020 epidemic period, high pollution concentrations were closely related to adverse meteorological conditions, with different parameters having different effects on the three pollution processes. In general, the unexpected reduction of anthropogenic emissions reduced the PM2.5 concentration, but led to an increase in the O3 concentration. Multi-scenario simulation results showed that anthropogenic emission reduction could reduce the average PM2.5 concentration after the Chinese Spring Festival, but improvement during days with heavy pollution was limited. Considering that O3 enhances the PM2.5 levels, to achieve the collaborative improvement of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, further research should explore the collaborative emission reduction scheme with VOCs and NOx to achieve the collaborative improvement of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations. The conclusions of this study provide a basis for designing a plan that guarantees improved air quality for the 2022 Winter Olympics and other international major events in Beijing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The threat of potential hazardous near-Earth asteroid (PHA) impact on Earth is increasingly attracting public attention. Monitoring and early warning of those PHAs are the premise of planetary defense. In this paper, we proposed a novel concept of surveillance constellation of heterogeneous wide-field near-Earth asteroid (NEA) surveyors (CROWN), in which six spacebased surveyors are loosely deployed in Venus-like orbits to detect the NEAs along the direction of the sunlight. First, the concept and overall design of the NEA surveillance constellation are discussed. Second, the transfer and deployment trajectory of the surveyors are investigated based on the Sun-Venus three-body system. The Sun-Venus libration orbit is taken as the parking orbit, and its stable invariant manifolds are used to reduce the deployment fuel consumption. Next, the detection performance of the CROWN was evaluated considering constraints of apparent visual magnitude and field of view. The NEA orbit determination (OD) using the CROWN was studied and verified. Simulation results show that the CROWN can be deployed with a total velocity increment of approximately 300 m/s. During the 5 years of observation, 99.8% of PHAs can be detected and the OD precision is better than a single-surveyor system. This paper can provide a reference for the construction of future asteroid defense system. Copyright © 2022 Xingyu Zhou et al. Exclusive Licensee Beijing Institute of Technology Press.

The sensors implementation in sugarcane operations is no exception. The objective of this work was to present the technological evolution and the state of the art of the sensors used in the monitoring, decision-making and management process for sugarcane cultivation. This review addresses the sensors involved in the agricultural operations of sugarcane production. For soil preparation and properties, the sensors involved in the diagnosis of compacted areas, depth of the soil preparation tool and monitoring the traction force. In planting, the monitored variable is the sugarcane stalks mass flow poured into the planting furrows. Optical remote sensing, vegetative index, ultrasonic, photoelectric and cameras are tools that help in the task of monitoring sugarcane cultivation. One of the significant challenges for fertilization is to quantify the soil need for nutrient replacement. In spraying, the implementation of sensors to detect pests or weeds. At harvest, the sensors used real-time yield estimation and the sensors for base cut height controlling. Finally, it was found that the integration of sensors of different physical principles to measure crop and soil attributes.

	abstract = {Data recorded automatically by harvesters are a promising and potentially very useful source of information for scientific analyses. Most researchers have used StanForD files for this purpose, but these are troublesome to obtain and require some pre-processing. This study utilized a new source of similar data: JDLink, a cloud-based service, run by the machine manufacturer, that stores data from sensors in real time. The vast amount of such data makes it hard to comprehend and handle efficiently. Data mining techniques assist in finding trends and patterns in such databases. Records from two mid-sized harvesters working in north-eastern Poland were analyzed using classical regression (linear and logarithmic), cluster analysis (dendrograms and k-means) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Linear regression showed that average tree size was the variable having the greatest effect on fuel consumption per cubic meter and productivity, whereas fuel consumption per hour was also dependent, e.g., on distance driven in a low gear or share of time with high engine load. Results of clustering and PCA were harder to interpret. Dendrograms showed most dissimilar variables: total volume harvested per day, total fuel consumption per day and share of work time on high revolutions per minute (RPMs). K-means clustering allowed us to identify periods when specific clusters of variables were more prominent. PCA results, despite explaining almost 90% of variance, were inconclusive between machines, and, therefore, need to be scrutinized in follow-up studies. Productivity values (avg. around 10 m3/h) and fuel consumption rates (13.21 L/h, 1.335 L/m3 on average) were similar to the results reported by other authors under comparable conditions. Some new measures obtained in this study include, e.g., distance driven in a low gear (around 7 km per day) or proportion of time when the engine was running on low, medium or high load (34%, 39% and 7%, respectively). The assumption of this study was to use data without supplementing from external sources, and with as little processing as possible, which limited the analytic methods to unsupervised learning. Extending the database in follow-up studies will facilitate the application of supervised learning techniques for modeling and prediction. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Coffee has high relevance in the Brazilian agricultural scenario, as Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of coffee in the world. Strategies to advance the production of coffee grains involve better understanding its spatial variability along fields. The objectives of this study were to adjust yield-prediction models based on a time series of satellite images and high-density yield data, and to indicate the best phenological stage of coffee crop to obtain satellite images for this purpose. The study was conducted during three seasons (2019, 2020 and 2021) in a commercial area (10.24 ha), located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data were obtained using a harvester equipped with a yield monitor that measures the volume of coffee harvested with 3.0 m of spatial resolution. Satellite images from the PlanetScope (PS) platform were used. Random forest (RF) regression and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were fitted to different datasets composed of coffee yield and time series of satellite-image data ((1) Spectral bands—red, green, blue and near-infrared; (2) Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); or (3) Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)). Whether using RF or MLR, the spectral bands, NDVI and GNDVI reproduced the spatial variability of yield maps one year before harvest. This information can be of critical importance for management decisions across the season. For yield quantification, the RF model using spectral bands showed the best results, reaching R2 of 0.93 for the validation set, and the lowest errors of prediction. The most appropriate phenological stage for satellite-image data acquisition was the dormancy phase, observed during the dry season months of July and August. These findings can help to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of the fields and guide management practices based on the premises of precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Agricultural machinery autonomous driving can improve work quality, enhance operational efficiency, reduce operating costs, and alleviate labor intensity. Autonomous driving technology for agricultural machinery is an important direction in the development of intelligent agricultural machinery systems. Driven by both policies and the market, China's autonomous driving technology for agricultural machinery has been rapidly developing and is gradually maturing through demonstration applications. The technological system for agricultural machinery autonomous driving is also being gradually established. Elementary technologies of agricultural machinery autonomous driving included environmental perception, working condition perception, decision-making and planning, lateral control, and longitudinal control. Firstly, the current status of key technology research for agricultural machinery autonomous driving was elaborated and the key scientific and technological issues that needed to be addressed were analyzed. And then the domestic and international research and application of agricultural machinery automatic driving products was introduced from the perspectives of automatic navigation technology and the integration and application of automatic driving systems. A comparison was made between the gap in grading standards and specifications for agricultural machinery autonomous driving and the intelligent connected vehicle industry, highlighting the urgent need for the classification of agricultural machinery autonomous driving. Finally, the main roles of agricultural machinery autonomous driving technology were summarized, and the future development directions for agricultural machinery autonomous driving were outlined. To address the challenges posed by the non-structured environment, high-precision agronomy, and time constraints in smart agricultural production, it was recommended to emphasize the dual requirements of precision operation and driving automation in agricultural production applications. Specifically, targeted efforts should be undertaken in the development of agricultural equipment autonomous driving technology, application demonstrations, and technological grading. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

	abstract = {Degradation of agricultural catchments due to water erosion is a major environmental threat at the global scale, with long-lasting destructive consequences valued at tens of billions of dollars per annum. Eroded soils lead to reduced crop yields and deprived agroecosystem's functioning through, for example, decreased water holding capacity, poor aeration, scarce microbial activity, and loose soil structure. This can result in reduced carbon sequestration, limited nutrient cycling, contamination of water bodies due to eutrophication, low protection from floods and poor attention restoration-consequences that go far beyond the commonly modelled soil loss and deposition budgets. This book demonstrates, using data from the Harod catchment in northern Israel, how cutting-edge geoinformatics, data science methodologies and soil health indicators can be used to measure, predict, and regulate these major environmental hazards. It shows how these approaches are used to quantify-in time and space-the effect of water erosion not only on the soil layer, soil minerals, and soil loss, but also on the wide-range of services that agricultural ecosystems might supply for the benefit and well-being of humans. The algorithms described in this book play a major role in this paradigm shift and they include, for example, extraction of photogrammetric DEMs from drone's data, advanced drainage structure calculations, fuzzy process-based modelling and spatial topographic threshold computations, multicriteria analyses and expert-based systems development using analytic hierarchal processes, innovative data-mining and machine learning tools, autocorrelation and interpolation of soil health, physically-based soil evolution models, spatial decision support systems and many more. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

	abstract = {Agricultural machinery has increasingly become a significant source of air pollution in China, more in-depth research is needed regarding the emissions. Given the seasonal and regional characteristics with agricultural machinery usage, it is necessary to accurately estimate the emission intensity and spatio-temporal distribution. This study using Beijing as the case study area, evaluated agricultural tractors emissions using remote monitoring and emission tests during 2020. The results show that tractors in Beijing emitted 80 t of carbon monoxide (CO), 21 t of hydrocarbons (HC), 104 t of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 10 t of particulate matter (PM), totalling 215 t in 2020 and that the emissions were unevenly distributed with the districts and counties of Beijing. Shunyi District contributed the most (31.546%) whilst Haidian District contributed the least, less than 1% of the total. The spatio-temporal variation of NOx and PM emissions showed that the higher emissions occurred in Spring and Autumn because of agricultural activities. Using the annual utilisation hours determined by remote monitoring throughout the year, the emission factors for tractors obtained from emission tests and the estimated emission inventory could supplement the emission database from agricultural machinery in the different regions of China to assist environmental pollution research and policy making. © 2021 IAgrE},

	abstract = {Agriculture and irrigation are sources of man 's potential. For the sake of cost-effectiveness and the betterment of agricultural professionals, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) can be deployed for surveillance, utilization of pesticides and insecticides, and detection of bioprocessing errors. With the proper collaboration and coordination of the clusters of UAVs forming a network, linked with a ground infrastructure or satellite will exceed the competencies of a single UAV system. However, one of the vital design issues FANETs deal with is in selecting the accurate routing protocol which is a prerequisite for the creation of FANET. In this chapter, the authors discuss the routing protocols of FANET in different platforms and different strategic manners. The open research challenges have been discussed and possible solutions have been attempted to be drawn from the conclusion. The main contribution lies in suggesting the most suitable routing protocol for each particular agriculture application based on the mobility model and requirement. © 2022, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {As today's agriculture industry is facing numerous challenges, including climate changes, encroachment of the urban environment, and lack of qualified farmers, there is a need for new practices to ensure sustainable agriculture and food supply. Consequently, there is an emphasis on upgrading farming practices by shifting toward smart farming (SF) - utilizing advanced information and communication technologies to improve the quantity and quality of the crop with minimal labor interference. SF has gained lots of interest in recent years utilizing a variety of technological innovations in the field, which imposes a challenge on farmers and technology integrators to identify suitable technologies and best practices for a particular application. This article provides a survey of the most recent SF scientific literature to identify common practices toward technology integration, challenges, and solutions. The survey was conducted on 588 papers published on the IEEE database following Cochrane methods to ensure appropriate analysis and interpretation of results. The papers' contributions were analyzed to identify necessary technologies that constitute SF, and consequently, research themes were identified. The identified themes are sensors, communication, big data, actuators and machines, and data analysis. Besides presenting an in-depth analysis of each identified theme, this article discusses integrating more than one technology in systems to achieve independency. The most common SF systems are remote monitoring, autonomous, and intelligent decision-making systems.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This experiment evaluated the performance of a combined geothermal heat pump and solar system (GHPS). A GHPS heating system was installed at a pig house and a comparative study was carried out between the environmentally friendly renewable energy source (GHPS) and the traditional heating method using fossil fuels. The impact of both heating systems on production performance, housing environment, noxious gas emission, and energy efficiency were evaluated along with the GHPS system performance parameters such as the coefficient of performance (COP), inlet and outlet water temperature and efficiency of solar collector. The average temperature inside the pig house was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the GHPS heating system. Similarly, the outflow temperature was increased significantly (p < 0.05) than the inflow temperature. The results of COP and efficiency of the solar system also indicated that the GHPS is an efficient heating system. The electricity consumption and carbon dioxide gas concentration were also reduced (p < 0.05) in the GHPS system. This study also predicts electricity consumption using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model. The results showed that the proposed model justifies all the acceptance criteria in terms of the correlation coefficient, root mean square value and mean absolute error. The results of our experiment show that the GHPS system can be installed at a pig house for sustainable swine production as a renewable energy source. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Combustion ignition (CI) engines for nonroad vehicles such as railway engines and marine engines provide greater output power with better fuel efficiency at a low cost. This has led to a rise in the use of such engines and made them popular over the decades. At the very exhaust of these engines, dangerous pollutants emitted are nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM). These emissions are proving to be fatal for nature as well as human health. This paper focusses on the importance of nonroad combustion ignition engines of power 560 kW or more, its effects on environment and reviewing previous solutions. The upcoming challenges and new ideas to reduce these pollutants are also discussed with adherence to the new environmental norms and policies adopted by different countries. Currently, aftertreatment technology is prominent in reducing these pollutants but as these policies are getting stringent, will this technology be efficient in the long run? Therefore, possible improving factors are suggested in this paper to extract 90% or more efficiency from the aftertreatment systems. The pollutant reduction methods that are reviewed are exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean NOx trap (LNT), diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Recently, many scientists are trying to find different alternate fuels such as blends of biodiesel and develop electric powertrains to eliminate these pollutants. The sole purpose of this review is to concentrate on the current capabilities and the possible improvements of the existing pollutant reduction techniques with respect to nonroad diesel engines and also provide a future perspective with the help of alternate fuels. © 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

	abstract = {In these modern days agriculture is one of the major concern to take out from the loss and need to be improvised in next level of production ratio. The latest technologies such as Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are associated with many applications to improve the standards as well as provide a drastic support to customers to achieve their communication needs. In this paper, a new agricultural robot is designed called as agriBOT, in which it is used to monitor the entire agricultural field and the associated crops in an intelligent manner by using Artificial Intelligence logic. The agriBOT has a provision to act like a drone to survey all fields in an intelligent manner. This provision allows the robot to move in all fields even the crops are in so dense, in which the agriBOT is integrated with many smart sensors to monitor the crop details well such as Soil Moisture Level Identifier, Crop Leaf Image Accumulator, Rain Identification Sensor and Surrounding Temperature level Identification Sensor. These sensors are associated with the proposed agriBOT to make the robot as powerful and robust in association with Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) strategies. The Internet of Things is used to carry the local sensor data from the agriBOT to the remote server for processing as well as the data available into the remote server can easily be monitored by the respective farmer from anywhere in the world at any time. The alert is utilized over the proposed agriBOT to pass the emergency condition alerts to the respective farmers instantly as well as the Global Positioning System (GPS) is utilized to retrieve the location details of the crop and report that to the server immediately by using IoT. This paper introduced a new machine learning strategy to analyze the server data, in which it is called as Modified Convolutional Neural Scheme (MCNS). This approach of MCNS provides the facility to predict the climate conditions and the associated crop details instantly based on the data which is collected already and stored into the server. With the association of these two strategies made the proposed approach of agricultural field monitoring system too robust and efficient to analyze the crop related details as well as the plant lea disease is also identified by using this approach based on the images captured by the agriBOT in an intellectual manner. All these details are experimentally tested and the resulting section provides the proper proof for the mentioned things. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This development has helped people to achieve many great scientific achievements, but this development has led to a rapid increase in the demand for electric energy in recent years. The traditional electricity supply from fossil fuels is gradually depleting, which has prompted the search for clean and renewable energy sources to gradually replace the dependence on this energy source. Prosumer, HEMS (home energy management system), and other solutions have been researched and applied to optimize electrical energy sources. However, for countries that mainly use fossil energy sources like Vietnam, these solutions are not effective. Policy on the management could help to solve this problem, in particular, the price policy is the solution that Vietnam has used to effectively manage this energy source.

	abstract = {To improve the reliability of vehicle state parameter estimation, a vehicle state fusion estimation method based on dichotomy is proposed. An extended Kalman filter algorithm is designed based on the vehicle 3 degrees of freedom dynamic model. Meanwhile, considering the influence of dynamic model and sensor noise and its coefficient selection on the estimation results, a radial basis function neural network estimation algorithm is designed. To further improve the reliability of the estimation algorithm, a method of estimation algorithm fusion is proposed based on the idea of mutual compensation between model- and data-driven estimation algorithms. The weights of the estimation results of different algorithms are assigned through the dichotomy. The redundancy and fusion of estimation algorithms can improve estimation performance. The effectiveness of the fusion method is verified by the co-simulation of MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim, and the real vehicle test. The results show that the change trend of the estimation result is consistent with the actual state parameters change trend, and the estimation accuracy after algorithm fusion is significantly improved compared to a single extended Kalman filter or radial basis function. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Rapid advancements in technology, particularly in soil tools and agricultural machinery, have led to the proliferation of mechanized agriculture. The interaction between such tools/machines and soil is a complex, dynamic process. The modeling of this interactive process is essential for reducing energy requirements, excessive soil pulverization, and soil compaction, thereby leading to sustainable crop production. Traditional methods that rely on simplistic physics-based models are not often the best approach. Computational intelligence-based approaches are an attractive alternative to traditional methods. These methods are highly versatile, can handle various forms of data, and are adaptive in nature. Recent years have witnessed a surge in adapting such methods in all domains of engineering, including agriculture. These applications leverage not only classical computational intelligence methods, but also emergent ones, such as deep learning. Although classical methods have routinely been applied to the soil–machine interaction studies, the field is yet to harness the more recent developments in computational intelligence. The purpose of this review article is twofold. Firstly, it provides an in-depth description of classical computational intelligence methods, including their underlying theoretical basis, along with a survey of their use in soil–machine interaction research. Hence, it serves as a concise and systematic reference for practicing engineers as well as researchers in this field. Next, this article provides an outline of various emergent methods in computational intelligence, with the aim of introducing state-of-the-art methods to the interested reader and motivating their application in soil–machine interaction research. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {No tillage (NT) is often presented as a means to grow crops with positive environmental externalities, such as enhanced carbon sequestration, improved soil quality, reduced soil erosion, and increased biodiversity. However, whether NT systems are as productive as those relying on conventional tillage (CT) is a controversial issue, fraught by a high variability over time and space. Here, we expand existing datasets to include the results of the most recent field experiments, and we produce a global dataset comparing the crop yields obtained under CT and NT systems. In addition to crop yield, our dataset also reports information on crop growing season, management practices, soil characteristics and key climate parameters throughout the experimental year. The final dataset contains 4403 paired yield observations between 1980 and 2017 for eight major staple crops in 50 countries. This dataset can help to gain insight into the main drivers explaining the variability of the productivity of NT and the consequence of its adoption on crop yields. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Rape biomass is one of the most important influencing factors for feed quantity, and operation quality, efficiency, and timely acquisition of feed quantity are of great significance to improve agricultural management. This paper aims to study the influencing factors and distribution law of rape biomass in the harvest period and establishes a prediction model on rape biomass. Firstly, the digital images of rape were taken by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and the actual biomass information was measured manually. 32 characteristic parameters related to rape biomass were extracted, and 10 characteristic parameters related to rape biomass were selected according to the significance test results and correlation analysis. With 10 selected features as input set and rape biomass as output, 3 prediction models of rape biomass based on random forest (RF), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) were established, respectively. Then, 3 established prediction models were trained using training set data, and parameters for the 3 prediction models were obtained. Finally, the 3 models were used to estimate rape biomass. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative error (RE) and determination coefficient (R2) of three models were 0.24 kg/m2, 0.04%-22.23%, 0.87, 0.36 kg/m2, 0.92%-21.14%, 0.71, and 0.28kg/m2, 0.28%-4.17%, 0.84, respectively. Compared to the estimation results of the 3 models, the RMSE estimation model based on RF was less than the models based on PCA and SVM; R2was the highest, and its RE was the smallest. Therefore, it is a better method to estimate rape biomass in the combined harvest period. The method of estimating rape biomass based on the UAV digital image proposed in this paper could provide reference and basis for intelligent prediction of feeding quantity in combined rape harvest operation. © 2021 Authors.

	abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) represents the biggest pool of carbon within the biosphere and influences the flux of greenhouse gases between land surface and atmosphere. In this regard, conservation tillage systems have been adopted to reduce negative impacts of conventional tillage practices on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. However, the role of these techniques to increase carbon sequestration also depends upon soil features and climatic conditions, which is studied and managed by precision agriculture (PA) principles and technologies. Simulation models have shown to be useful tools to understand the interaction between soil, climate, genotypes and management practices to simulate the long-term effects of management approaches of different soils on crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, and GHG emissions. The research goals of this study are (1) to examine the mid-term (15 years) trajectory of SOC in the upper 0.4 m of the soil profile under different tillage systems using the SALUS model; (2) determine the impact of PA on the inputs to the crop and CO2 emissions; (3) identify the strategies, derived from the synergy between conservation agriculture and PA, so as to decrease the CO2 emissions of agricultural systems. The validated SALUS simulation showed a significant reduction in SOC losses in minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT), 17% and 63% respectively, compared to conventional tillage (CT). Furthermore, the adoption of conservation tillage techniques decreased carbon emissions related to farming operations, while PA technologies led to an optimization of the exhaustible sources such as fossil fuels and fertilizers. Finally, the synergy between conservation tillage systems, especially NT, and PA strategies represents a useful tool in terms of carbon emissions mitigation with a reduction of 56% of total CO2 as compared to CT. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The commercial fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications networks have already been deployed with the aim of providing high data rates. However, the rapid growth in the number of smart devices and the emergence of the Internet of Everything (IoE) applications, which require an ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, will result in a substantial burden on the 5G wireless networks. As such, the data rate that could be supplied by 5G networks will unlikely sustain the enormous ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to advance the existing wireless networks toward the future generation of cellular systems, known as sixth generation (6G). Therefore, it is essential to provide a prospective vision of the 6G and the key enabling technologies for realizing future networks. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review/survey of the future evolution of 6G networks. Specifically, the objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive review/survey about the key enabling technologies for 6G networks, which include a discussion about the main operation principles of each technology, envisioned potential applications, current state-of-the-art research, and the related technical challenges.

	abstract = {An increasing number of objects (things) are being connected to the Internet as they become more advanced, compact, and affordable. These Internet-connected objects are paving the way toward the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is a distributed network of low-powered, low-storage, light-weight and scalable nodes. Most low-power IoT sensors and embedded IoT devices are powered by batteries with limited lifespans, which need replacement every few years. This replacement process is costly, so smart energy management could play a vital role in enabling energy efficiency for communicating IoT objects. For example, harvesting of energy from naturally or artificially available environmental resources removes IoT networks’ dependence on batteries. Scavenging unlimited amounts of energy in contrast to battery-powered solutions makes IoT systems long-lasting. Thus, here we present energy-harvesting and sub-systems for IoT networks. After surveying the options for harvesting systems, distribution approaches, storage devices and control units, we highlight future design challenges of IoT energy harvesters that must be addressed to continuously and reliably deliver energy. © 2020},

	abstract = {The monitoring systems on the climatic conditions in the agriculture industry are increasingly useful and applicable since they allow to improve the processes of growth in the plants. This paper develops a monitoring system for the germination of Ocimum basilicum seeds using image processing and fuzzy logic techniques. Besides, the system is based on the Cloudino-IoT and FIWARE platforms as a real-time monitoring alternative. Therefore, temperature and humidity parameters can be observed in real-time. On the one hand, the system controls the variables through fuzzy control techniques and image processing monitors the germination in the radicle seed, and on the other, context data is used by the Cloudino-IoT and FIWARE platforms. On the other hand, the use of these combined open-source platforms allows cloud computing to be enabled to maintain, specify, analyze the data and automate the environmental parameters that allow maintaining temperature and humidity levels at optimal levels to create a favorable germination environment. The performance of the set-point control is compared with experimental results and the function interconnection of the IoT devices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study was set up to model and optimize the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with carbon nanoparticle-dosed water/‎diesel emulsion fuel using a combination of soft computing techniques. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system tuned by particle ‎swarm algorithm was used for modeling the performance and emission parameters of the engine, while optimization of the engine operating parameters and the fuel composition was conducted via multiple-objective particle ‎swarm algorithm. The model input variables were: injection timing (35–41° CA BTDC), engine load (0–100%), nanoparticle dosage (0–150 μM), and water content (0–3 wt%). The model output variables included: brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, as well as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons emission concentrations. The training and testing of the modeling system were performed on the basis of 60 data patterns obtained from the experimental trials. The effects of input variables on the performance and emission characteristics of the engine were thoroughly analyzed and comprehensively discussed as well. According to the experimental results, injection timing and engine load could significantly affect all the investigated performance and emission parameters. Water and nanoparticle addition to diesel could markedly affect some performance and emission parameters. The modeling system could predict the output parameters with an R2 > 0.93, MSE < 5.70 × 10−3, RMSE < 7.55 × 10−2, and MAPE < 3.86 × 10−2. The optimum conditions were: injection timing of 39° CA BTDC, engine load of 74%, nanoparticle dosage of 112 μM, and water content of 2.49 wt%. The carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbon emission concentrations ‎were found to be ‎7.26‎ vol%‎, ‎0.46 vol%‎, ‎95.7‎ ppm, and‎ 36.2 ppm, respectively, under the ‎selected optimal operating conditions while the quantity of brake thermal efficiency was found at an acceptable level (‎34.0‎%).‎ In general, the applied soft computing combination appears to be a promising approach to model and optimize operating parameters and fuel composition of diesel engines. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Together with the complex dynamics of the onboard hydraulically actuated cranes, the rough forest terrains have posed a particular challenge in forestry automation. In this study, the feasibility of applying reinforcement learning control to forestry crane manipulators is investigated in a simulated environment. Our results show that it is possible to learn successful actuator-space control policies for energy efficient log grasping by invoking a simple curriculum in a deep reinforcement learning setup. Given the pose of the selected logs, our best control policy reaches a grasping success rate of 97%. Including an energy-optimization goal in the reward function, the energy consumption is significantly reduced compared to control policies learned without incentive for energy optimization, while the increase in cycle time is marginal. The energy-optimization effects can be observed in the overall smoother motion and acceleration profiles during crane manipulation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The human dimension plays an essential role in the energy performance of buildings and is considered as significant as technological advances. Several studies highlighted the negative influence of occupant behaviour in underperforming buildings, while some support that technological innovations may reduce human-related uncertainties. Thus, one may consider that fully automated smart buildings are essential to achieve energy efficiency. However, if technology excludes people from decision-making processes, low acceptance and comfort/welfare levels may be reported from users. Therefore, the right combination of humans and technologies are expected to solve these problems. Buildings are emerging as complex Cyber-Physical Systems, including the Social dimension, and this provides an excellent opportunity to achieve high-performance outcomes, considering both technical and social aspects. Thus, the right choice among available up-to-date behavioural sensing – comprising active and passive sensors, as well as Kinect technology – are important in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era. IoT-driven buildings can use real-time monitoring data to inform users and drive behavioural-based consumption change, which is an important aspect to achieve high-performance buildings and deliver user-centred services. An essential feature in this regard is to allow for human-in-the-loop approaches enabled by human-centric computing and smart devices, which has grown fast in the last few years. This literature review summarises applications and main challenges related to the combination of the human dimension and technological innovations in the building sector. This combination is expected to increase user welfare and reduce the energy consumption in buildings, as human and machine components of intelligence may complement each other regarding building performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Since the 20th century, portable electronic devices such as laptops, cell phones, tablets, and medical implants have emerged in our daily life. All these devices are mainly power supplied by batteries. However, their lifespan is a major disadvantage. This challenge becomes more critical when it comes to Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs). Therefore, Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is considered as a promising alternative to overcome this challenge. The near-field magnetic WPT approach is a common-used way to power-up active implants wirelessly. Although many improvements have made on the implant’s design and their remote powering approaches, stringent requirements and several parameters should be considered during the design of the WPT system, such as the power transfer efficiency, the transfer distance, the implant size, and its biocompatibility. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the commonly proposed approaches to power-up IMDs have been reviewed. In particular, various advanced mechanisms and technical solutions related to the Near-field magnetic WPT approach have been discussed. These solutions are carried out to optimize transcutaneous WPT transfer efficiency, maintaining robustness and safety against many factors such as coil misalignments and load variations. Human safety concerns and exposure limits to the electromagnetic field by respecting international guidelines are also explored in this review. Finally, a summary of relevant information and directions for future research investigations are provided. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Even though the significance of both sustainability and intelligence is well recognized by academia, industry, as well as governments, and substantial efforts are devoted to both areas, the intersection of the two has not been fully exploited. Conventionally, studies in sustainable manufacturing and smart manufacturing have different objectives and employ different tools. Nevertheless, in the design and implementation of smart factories, sustainability, and energy efficiency are supposed to be important goals. Moreover, big data based decision-making techniques that are developed and applied for smart manufacturing have great potential in promoting the sustainability of manufacturing. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of sustainable and smart manufacturing is first reviewed based on the PRISMA framework, with a focus on how they interact and benefit each other. Key problems in both fields are then identified and discussed. Specially, different technologies emerging in the 4th industrial revolution and their dedications on sustainability are discussed. In addition, the impacts of smart manufacturing technologies on sustainable energy industry are analyzed. Finally, opportunities and challenges in the intersection of the two are identified for future investigation.

The results showed significant global space positive correlation in agro-ecosystems carbon emissions in Northeast China, and the global Moran's I index in 2014 reached the highest value. On the local spatial correlation, the high-high areas of agro-ecosystem carbon emissions were concentrated in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province, while low-low areas were mainly concentrated in Liaoning Province, showing an unbalanced development pattern. GDP per capita had a negative effect on agro-ecosystem carbon emissions, while the impact of total affected population on agro-ecosystem carbon emissions changed from positive to negative. The spatial distribution of impact by application of chemical fertilizer on agro-ecosystem carbon emissions changed significantly.

	abstract = {In recent years, environmental impacts of energy consumption in different production systems have become more adverse. Agricultural systems, as results of food security and production growth, are nowadays significant energy consumers. Owing to various reasons, energy consumption in these systems, especially those in developing countries, are often inefficient. As such, there are three objectives in this study. The first objective is the assessment of energy flow, cumulative exergy demand and life cycle of paddy fields. The second goal is the optimization of energy consumption by employing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for enhancement of energy efficiency (reduction in energy consumption and increase performance in paddy production) and reduction of adverse environmental effects in paddy production. The third objective is the provision of the optimum pattern of energy consumption in paddy production in Guilan Province of Iran. Optimization results indicate that energy savings by employing DEA and MOGA are 21.15% and 71.63%, respectively. They indicate that the enhancement of the efficiency of paddy production is mainly in terms of toxins and chemical fertilizers. Besides, all adverse environmental impacts by MOGA are significantly less than from its counterparts by DEA and present farms. The most significant difference between MOGA and DEA is associated to ozone layer depletion. As a result, MOGA can be introduced as an adequate optimization method to determine the best mix of paddy production inputs, minimizing adverse environmental impact and maximizing performances of farms and energy efficiency simultaneously. This study highlights the utilization and the performance of MOGA in paddy production systems to determine the optimized composition for mixing energy, yield and environmental impacts. The implementation of the recommended consumption patterns will be able to attain sustainable development in paddy production in Guilan province of Iran, owing to the protection of non-renewable resources, the reduction of adverse environmental effects and the improvement of economic conditions for rice farmers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry 4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. © 2020},

	abstract = {Extensive digitization and interconnection through networks have ushered in a number of new paradigms over the last years: Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, etc. These challenging systems rely on an effective information communication between distributed components. Therefore, the heterogeneity of entities, both hardware and software, must be handled to achieve an operative interoperability and a proper behavior. However, there is also a heterogeneous availability of solutions; different technologies, protocols, and architectures aim to achieve a seamless interconnection. Henceforth, the standardization still requires great efforts from industrial and scientific environments. In this sense, the interface of the open platform communications (OPC) has supported connectivity for automation and supervision infrastructures for more than two decades. The OPC comprises the so-called classic OPC, the original protocol, as well as the last specification, unified architecture (UA). The widespread utilization of the classic OPC together with the powerful functionalities of OPC UA, make the latter one of the main candidates to lead the standardization and systems integration. This paper presents a survey of recent OPC-based systems reported in scientific literature for different domains as well as research projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a broad perspective about the OPC’ applicability and capabilities in order to support the decision about communication interfaces. The results are analyzed and discussed putting special attention on the aforementioned new paradigms. Finally, the main conclusions and open research directions are highlighted. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Innovative Internet of Things (IoT) applications with strict performance and energy consumption requirements and where the agile collection of data is paramount are arising. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent a promising solution as they can be easily deployed to sense, process, and forward data. The large number of Sensor Nodes (SNs) composing a WSN are expected to be autonomous, with a node’s lifetime dictated by the battery’s size. As the form factor of the SN is critical in various use cases, minimizing energy consumption while ensuring availability becomes a priority. Moreover, energy harvesting techniques are increasingly considered as a viable solution for building an entirely green SN and prolonging its lifetime. In the process of building a SN and in the absence of a clear and well-rounded methodology, the designer can easily make unfounded and suboptimal decisions about the right hardware components, their configuration, and reliable data communication techniques, such as automatic repeat request (ARQ) and forward error correction (FEC). In this paper, a methodology to design, configure, and deploy a reliable ultra-low power WSNs is proposed. A comprehensive energy model and a realistic path-loss (PL) model of the sensor node are also established. Through estimations and field measurements it is proven that, following the proposed methodology, the designer can thoroughly explore the design space and the make most favorable decisions when choosing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, configuring the node, and deploying a reliable and energy-efficient WSN. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {For many years, RF wireless harvesting systems have been investigated, but only a few of RF sources have been able to generate sufficient energy that can be used as feasible source for implantable medical devices like implantable rectenna, it could provide unlimited energy for the lifespan of implanted devices. In order to harvest the maximum power from implanted rectenna, power management system is needed. However, most of power management systems are not efficient due to power consumption in control circuitry. This paper presents a fabricated rectenna with 63% power efficiency and an optimized power management circuit to improve the efficiency of DC-DC converter, where the rectenna is used as power source, this is accomplished by using particle swarm optimization technique. This design improves the efficiency of optimized power management circuit by 10% comparing with conventional power management circuits over a wide range of input power, allowing harvesting more power from rectenna and delivering it to medical device; it can extend the battery life of implantable medical devices. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the framework of evidence theory, one of the open and crucial issues is how to determine the basic probability assignment (BPA), which is directly related to whether the decision result is correct. This paper proposes a novel method for obtaining BPA based on Adaboost. The method uses training data to generate multiple strong classifiers for each attribute model, which is used to determine the BPA of the singleton proposition since the weights of classification provide necessary information for fundamental hypotheses. The BPA of the composite proposition is quantified by calculating the area ratio of the singleton proposition’s intersection region. The recursive formula of the area ratio of the intersection region is proposed, which is very useful for computer calculation. Finally, BPAs are combined by Dempster’s rule of combination. Using the proposed method to classify the Iris dataset, the experiment concludes that the total recognition rate is 96.53% and the classification accuracy is 90% when the training percentage is 10%. For the other datasets, the experiment results also show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective, and the proposed method performs well in the case of insufficient samples. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Information regarding sugarcane yield is the starting point for the application of Precision Agriculture (PA) strategies to the management of sugarcane fields. Over the years, many sugarcane yield monitoring approaches have been developed and tested, but its use is still limited. One option is to use data generated by the sugarcane harvester provided in the controller area network (CAN), which allows getting the messages related to the harvester operation. Our goal was to train and to test random forest (RF), multiple linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) using CAN data available on the on-board computer of the harvester. All predictive models were trained and tested using the main engine parameters: fuel consumption, engine rotation, engine power, and specific fuel consumption (SFC) as data input. A scale yield monitor was installed on the harvester elevator to provide the georeferenced yield data. The yield prediction accuracy of the predictive models using the four parameters was compared. All models followed the observed sugarcane yield and recognized the changes over the time of data collection. The MLR and ANN models have a higher error of prediction in the extreme values of yield. Over the testing time, the ANN underestimated the sugarcane yield, and the RF prediction by the engine parameters of the harvester was coming closest to the observed yield. The best results for predicting sugarcane yield by engine parameters were obtained from the RF model with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 5.6%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.0 Mg ha−1. The MLR and ANN models have a MAPE of 7.8% and 5.6%, respectively. All the variables were necessary for a better performance of the models; however, SFC was the most important variable for predicting sugarcane yield. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Crop sensing technologies to aid nitrogen management in grain crops have been the focus of an important element of Precision/Digital Agriculture research. We review sensor-based application research to explore the outcomes from this technology and provide guidelines for future developments in its application. Most studies report N fertilizer savings of 5–45% with little effect on grain yield, but a lack of consistent evidence of economic benefits limits adoption by farmers. Reported impacts on profit usually ranged between losses of US$ 30 ha−1 and profits of US$ 70 ha−1, with an overall average profit of US$ 30 ha−1; about 25% of studies reported economic losses from sensor-based N applications. Sensor-based N applications which reduced environmental impacts were often not profitable compared to current N practices. Some methodological aspects of the research have also made interpretation of the benefits difficult as the value of the information used to recommend N rates and improved agronomy was often confounded with the value of sensor-based variable rate technology itself. Traditional plot experiments adopted in most studies are not the ideal method to evaluate variable rate technologies implemented to accommodate the effects of spatial variability. Neither simple fertilizer redistribution functions nor calibrated sensor algorithms, with or without the use of reference N-rich strips, were necessarily successful across a range of field conditions. New approaches to sensor-based site-specific N management are needed and it is likely the best approaches will arise from the use of multiple sensors. © 2018},

In the present study, energy input and output were audited to optimize energy use in rice cultivation using data collected from 40 farmers during face-to-face interview. Average total energy input (EI) of 52.4 ± 1.3 GJ ha−1 produced total energy output (EO) of 259 ± 4.7 GJ ha−1, with energy productivity (EP) of 0.16 kg MJ−1. Results revealed that rice cultivation was energy efficient with energy ratio (ER) of 5.0 ± 0.12 and net energy gain (NEG) of 206 ± 4.5 GJ ha−1. In rice, irrigation water (∼40%) and chemical fertilizers (24.7%) had highest contribution towards EI. A non-parametric production function of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) applied to optimize energy use in rice, elucidated 20 decision making units (DMUs) as efficient, whilst 50% as inefficient. The average technical efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE) and scale efficiency (SE) of rice farms were 0.94, 0.97 and 0.97, respectively. Our results revealed that between 9.4 and 2170 MJ ha−1 energy (0.2 and 46.9% of total saving) could be saved, if inefficient DMUs adopt the management practices of efficient DMUs. An average energy saving of 579 ± 166 MJ ha−1 by efficient DMUs accounts for ∼8.8% of the EI. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Large-scale agricultural machinery cooperatives require technical statistic report of agricultural machinery operations to improve the efficiency of fleet management. This research proposed a smartphone-based solution to build the behavior model for agricultural machinery operations by using the embedded sensors including the GNSS, the accelerometer, and the microphone. The whole working process of agricultural machinery operation was divided into four stages: preparation, operation, U-turn, and transfer, each of which may contain the behaviors of stalling and idling. Field experiments were carried out by skilled operators, whose operations were typical agricultural machinery operations that could be used to extract behavior features. Butterworth low-pass filter was used to smooth the output from the accelerometer. Then, the operating data were collected through an APP when sowing the forage maize as a case study. Four stages of machinery operation can be preliminarily classified by using GNSS speed, while the identification of behaviors such as sudden acceleration and longtime idling that may increase fuel consumption, reduce machinery life, or decrease the working efficiency, requires extra informat ion such as acceleration and sound intensity. The results showed that the jerk of accelerating can describe the severity of the sudden acceleration, the standard deviation of forward acceleration can reflect the smoothness of operation, the upward acceleration can be used to identify behaviors of stalling and idling, and the sound intensity during idling can capture the behavior of goosing the throttle. Further, the operating behavior figure can be drawn based on the above parameters. In conclusion, this research constructed several behavior models of agricultural machinery and operators by using smartphone’s sensor data and established the base of the online assessing and scoring system for agricultural machinery operations. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Advances in wireless sensors, biomedical devices, and micro-robotics exert more pressure on creating reliable, miniaturized, and self-sustained energy supply solutions for these micro-electromechanical systems. Rotational energy harvesting (REH) is one of the rapidly growing areas for self-powered electronics using available rotational energy or energy converted from other sources in the environment. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art progress in REH in terms of the available energy characteristics, harvester categories, adopted methodologies and mechanisms, and promising applications. Unique mechanisms and methodologies, such as using gravity and centrifugal force combined with other nonlinear mechanisms, are discussed and characterized.

	abstract = {Wind turbine control is an important task to make the electricity generation secure in terms of energy demand and machine safety. It also yields to control the desired power level and optimized energy because of the assignment of turbine speed. The contactless piezoelectric wind energy harvester (CPWEH) used in this study has three piezoelectric layers located around the shaft with 120 degrees apart and they are buckled by the magnetic force without any physical contact. The superiority of this device is to generate energy for low wind speeds such as 1.5 m/s. However, for high speeds, high total harmonic distortions (THDs) govern the waveforms, thus controlling the turbine speed becomes necessary for optimizing the output power. Encouraged by this, a small low inertia dc generator is coupled with the wind turbine, and the generator terminals are connected to a resistor through a power switch to generate a braking torque that opposes to wind speed direction. By controlling the switch properly, turbine speed is ensured to remain within a certain band, which accordingly prevents the turbine from rotating very fast at damaging wind speeds. Several experiments are performed on the developed CPWEH with/without the presented control scheme which prove the existence of promising performance of our proposal. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The global economy is now under threat due to the ongoing domestic and international lockdown for COVID-19. Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world’s population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The paper’s main purpose was to identify and present the current situation and changes in energy consumption in agriculture in the European Union (EU) countries. The specific objectives were the determination of the degree of concentration of energy consumption in agriculture in the EU countries, showing the directions of their changes, types of energy used, and changes in this respect, establishing the correlation between energy consumption and changes in the economic and agricultural situation in the EU countries. All member states of the European Union were deliberately selected for research on 31 December 2018 (28 countries). The research period covered the years 2005–2018. The sources of materials were the literature on the subject, and data from Eurostat. Descriptive, tabular, and graphical methods were used to analyze and present materials, dynamics indicators with a stable base, Gini concentration coefficient, concentration analysis using the Lorenz curve, coefficient of variation, Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. A high concentration of energy consumption in agriculture was found in several EU countries, the largest in countries with the largest agricultural sector, i.e., France and Poland. There were practically no changes in the concentration level. Only in the case of renewable energy, a gradual decrease in concentration was visible. More and more countries developed technologies that allow the use of this type of energy. However, the EU countries differed in terms of the structure of the energy sources used. The majority of the basis was liquid fuels, while stable and gaseous fuels were abandoned in favor of electricity and renewable sources—according to which, in the EU countries, the research hypothesis was confirmed: a gradual diversification of energy sources used in agriculture, with a systematic increase in the importance of renewable energy sources. The second research hypothesis was also confirmed, according to which the increase in the consumption of renewable energy in agriculture is closely related to the economy’s parameters. The use of renewable energy is necessary and results from concern for the natural environment. Therefore, economic factors may have a smaller impact. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to CA-device’s unique working principle, the traditional shifting strategy is not suitable for CA-device. Apply traditional shifting strategy to CA-device will result in frequent or incorrect shifting. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes applying the working condition identification to the CA-device shifting strategy. Combining the working principle of PRHTS with CA-device and the analysis of WL V-condition, the requirement for the working condition identification algorithm of the CA-device shifting strategy is obtained, and a working condition identification algorithm for WL V-condition is designed. Simulation results show that applying the working condition identification algorithm to the CA-device shifting strategy can avoid frequent shifts and incorrect shifts. A hardware-in-the-loop platform is built to verify the real-time performance of the shifting strategy. Results show that the proposed shifting strategy exhibits a satisfactory level of real-time performance. © IMechE 2020.},

Data were collected using face-to-face questionnaire from 67 farms in central region of Hamedan province. The DEA method was used based on seven input costs including human labour, land rent, seed, water for irrigation, fertilizers, biocide and machinery and single output of barley yield. The technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of farmers were calculated as 0.812, 0.970 and 0.834, respectively. Total optimum cost requirement was found to be about 879 $ ha-1; showing that 10.09% of input costs could be saved if the farmers follow the results recommended by this study. Moreover the contribution of water for irrigation input from total cost saving was 63.77% which was the highest share followed by chemical fertilizers and machinery input costs. Optimization of input costs use improved the benefit/cost ratio, productivity and net return by 11.61%, 11.27% and 10.25%, respectively. © Copyright 2010 All rights reserved Integrated Publishing Association},

From the system design perspective, there are numerous indicators affecting the performance of such vehicles, in which the powertrain type, component configuration, and energy management strategy (EMS) play a key role. Achieving an energy-efficient powertrain requires tackling several conflicting control objectives such as the drivability, fuel economy, reduced emissions, and battery state of charge preservation, which make the EMS the most crucial aspect of powertrain system design. Accordingly, in the present study, various powertrain systems and topologies of (plug-in) hybrid electric vehicles and full-electric vehicles are assessed. In addition, EMSs as applied in the literature are systematically surveyed for a qualitative investigation, classification, and comparison of existing approaches in terms of the principles, advantages, and drawbacks through a comprehensive review. Furthermore, potential challenges considering the gaps in research are addressed, and directives paving the way toward further development of powertrains and EMSs in all respects are thoroughly provided. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Current access infrastructures are characterized by heterogeneity, low latency, high throughput, and high computational capability, enabling massive concurrent connections and various services. Unfortunately, this design does not pay significant attention to mobile services in underserved areas. In this context, the use of aerial radio access networks (ARANs) is a promising strategy to complement existing terrestrial communication systems. Involving airborne components such as unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and satellites, ARANs can quickly establish a flexible access infrastructure on demand. ARANs are expected to support the development of seamless mobile communication systems toward a comprehensive sixth-generation (6G) global access infrastructure. This paper provides an overview of recent studies regarding ARANs in the literature. First, we investigate related work to identify areas for further exploration in terms of recent knowledge advancements and analyses. Second, we define the scope and methodology of this study. Then, we describe ARAN architecture and its fundamental features for the development of 6G networks. In particular, we analyze the system model from several perspectives, including transmission propagation, energy consumption, communication latency, and network mobility. Furthermore, we introduce technologies that enable the success of ARAN implementations in terms of energy replenishment, operational management, and data delivery. Subsequently, we discuss application scenarios envisioned for these technologies. Finally, we highlight ongoing research efforts and trends toward 6G ARANs.  © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

In this chapter, the authors conduct a systematic review focusing on big data and artificial intelligence in agriculture. To further guide the literature review process and organize the findings, they devise a framework based on extant literature. The framework is aimed to capture key aspects of agricultural processes, supporting supply chain, key stakeholders with a particular emphasis on the potential, drivers, and challenges of big data and artificial intelligence.

	abstract = {Purpose: Recycled waste glasses have been widely used in Portland cement and concrete as aggregate or supplementary cementitious material. Compressive strength is one of the most important properties of concrete containing waste glasses, providing information about the loading capacity, pozzolanic reaction and porosity of the mixture. This study aims to propose highly nonlinear models to predict the compressive strength of concrete containing finely ground glass particles. Design/methodology/approach: A robust machine leaning method called genetic programming is used the build the compressive strength prediction models. The models are developed using a number of test results on 50-mm mortar cubes containing glass powder according to ASTM C109. Parametric and sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the effect of the predictor variables on the compressive strength. Furthermore, a comparative study is performed to benchmark the proposed models against classical regression models. Findings: The derived design equations accurately characterize the compressive strength of concrete with ground glass fillers and remarkably outperform the regression models. A key feature of the proposed models as compared to the previous studies is that they include the simultaneous effect of various parameters such as glass compositions, size distributions, curing age and isothermal temperatures. Parametric and sensitivity analyses indicate that compressive strength is very sensitive to the curing age, curing temperature and particle surface area. Originality/value: This study presents accurate machine learning models for the prediction of one of the most important mechanical properties of cementitious mixtures modified by waste glass, i.e. compressive strength. In addition, it provides an insight into the effect of several parameters influencing the compressive strength. From a computing perspective, a robust machine learning technique that overcomes the shortcomings of existing soft computing methods is introduced. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) mobile networks are envisaged to enable a plethora of breakthrough advancements in wireless technologies, providing support of a diverse set of services over a single platform. While the deployment of 5G systems is scaling up globally, it is time to look ahead for beyond 5G systems. This is mainly driven by the emerging societal trends, calling for fully automated systems and intelligent services supported by extended reality and haptics communications. To accommodate the stringent requirements of their prospective applications, which are data-driven and defined by extremely low-latency, ultra-reliable, fast and seamless wireless connectivity, research initiatives are currently focusing on a progressive roadmap towards the sixth generation (6G) networks, which are expected to bring transformative changes to this premise. In this article, we shed light on some of the major enabling technologies for 6G, which are expected to revolutionize the fundamental architectures of cellular networks and provide multiple homogeneous artificial intelligence-empowered services, including distributed communications, control, computing, sensing, and energy, from its core to its end nodes. In particular, the present paper aims to answer several 6G framework related questions: What are the driving forces for the development of 6G? How will the enabling technologies of 6G differ from those in 5G? What kind of applications and interactions will they support which would not be supported by 5G? We address these questions by presenting a comprehensive study of the 6G vision and outlining seven of its disruptive technologies, i.e., mmWave communications, terahertz communications, optical wireless communications, programmable metasurfaces, drone-based communications, backscatter communications and tactile internet, as well as their potential applications. Then, by leveraging the state-of-the-art literature surveyed for each technology, we discuss the associated requirements, key challenges, and open research problems. These discussions are thereafter used to open up the horizon for future research directions. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Kernel Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied to numerous fields owing to their high-accuracy and ability to analyze the non-linear problems. In this study, these machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are used to predict emission and performance characteristics of a CI engine fuelled with various metal-oxide based nanoparticles (Al2O3, CuO, and TiO2) at a mass fractions of 200 ppm. Assessed parameters in the study are carbon dioxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE). To evaluate the success of algorithms, four metrics (R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MBE) are discussed in detail. Tests performed at varying engine speeds from 1500 rpm to 3400 rpm with the intervals of 100 rpm. The addition of nanoparticles simultaneously reduced CO and NOx emissions because they ensured more complete combustion thanks to their inherent oxygen, the higher surface to volume ratio, superior thermal conductivities and their catalytic activity role. Further, the nano-sized particles ensured an accelerated heat transfer from the combustion chamber. In comparison with that of neat diesel fuel, the reduction in NOx is found to be 3.28, 7.53, and 10.05%, and the reduction in CO is found to be 8.3, 11.6, and 15.5% for TiO2, Al2O3, and CuO test fuels, respectively. Moreover, the presence of nanoparticles in test fuels has improved engine performance. As compared with those of neat diesel fuel, the doping of nanoparticles drops the BSFC value by 5.54, 7.89, and 9.96% for TiO2, CuO, and Al2O3, respectively, and enhanced BTE value to be 6.15, 8.87, and 11.23% for TiO2, CuO, and Al2O3, respectively. On the other hand, it can be said that all algorithms presented very satisfying results in the prediction of CI engine responses. All R2 has changed between 0.901 and 0.994, and DL has given the highest R2 value for each engine response. In terms of rRMSE, all results (except for one result in k-NN) are categorized as “excellent” according to the classification in the literature. Considering all metrics together, DL is giving the best results in the prediction of engine responses for the dataset used in this paper. Then it is closely followed by ANN, SVM, and k-NN algorithms, respectively. In conclusion, this paper is proving that the nanoparticle addition for ICEs is significantly dropping the exhaust pollutants, and improving the engine performance, and further the results can be successfully predicted with the machine learning algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In mechanized logging operations, interactions between the forest machines and their operators, forest resources and environmental conditions are multifold and not easily detected. However, increased computational resources and sensing capabilities of the forest machines together with extensive forest inventory data enable modeling of such relationships, leading eventually to better planning of the operations, better assistance for the forest machine operators, and increased efficiency of timber harvesting. In this study, both forest machine fieldbus data and forest inventory data were acquired extensively. The forest inventory data, acquired nationwide, was clustered to categorize general tree and soil types in Finland. The found forest categories were applied when the harvester fieldbus data, collected from the forest operations in the North Karelia region with two similar harvesters, was analyzed. When the performance of the machine and the operator, namely the fuel consumption and log production, is studied individually for each forest cluster, the impact of working environment no longer masks the causes based on the machine or the operator, thus making the observations from separate forest locations comparable. The study observed statistically significant differences in fuel consumption between the most general tree and soil clusters as well as between the harvester-operator units. The modeling approach applied, based on multivariate linear regression, finds such reasons for the differences that have clear interpretation from machine setup or operator working style perspective, and thus offers a feasible method for assisting the operators in improving their working practices and thus the overall performance specifically at forest of given type. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Agricultural activity has always been threatened by the presence of pests and diseases that prevent the proper development of crops and negatively affect the economy of farmers. One of these pests is Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR), which is a fungal epidemic disease that affects coffee trees and causes massive defoliation. As an example, this disease has been affecting coffee trees in Colombia (the third largest producer of coffee worldwide) since the 1980s, leading to devastating losses between 70% and 80% of the harvest. Failure to detect pathogens at an early stage can result in infestations that cause massive destruction of plantations and significantly damage the commercial value of the products. The most common way to detect this disease is by walking through the crop and performing a human visual inspection. As a result of this problem, different research studies have proven that technological methods can help to identify these pathogens. Our contribution is an experiment that includes a CLR development stage diagnostic model in the Coffea arabica, Caturra variety,scale crop through the technological integration of remote sensing (through drone capable multispectral cameras), wireless sensor networks (multisensor approach), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Our diagnostic model achieved an F1-score of 0.775. The analysis of the results revealed a p-value of 0.231, which indicated that the difference between the disease diagnosis made employing a visual inspection and through the proposed technological integration was not statistically significant. The above shows that both methods were significantly similar to diagnose the disease. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found numerous applications and are expected to bring fertile business opportunities in the next decade. Among various enabling technologies for UAVs, wireless communication is essential and has drawn significantly growing attention in recent years. Compared to the conventional terrestrial communications, UAVs' communications face new challenges due to their high altitude above the ground and great flexibility of movement in the 3-D space. Several critical issues arise, including the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant UAV-ground channels and induced strong aerial-terrestrial network interference, the distinct communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for UAV control messages versus payload data, the stringent constraints imposed by the size, weight, and power (SWAP) limitations of UAVs, as well as the exploitation of the new design degree of freedom (DoF) brought by the highly controllable 3-D UAV mobility. In this article, we give a tutorial overview of the recent advances in UAV communications to address the above issues, with an emphasis on how to integrate UAVs into the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) and future cellular networks. In particular, we partition our discussion into two promising research and application frameworks of UAV communications, namely UAV-assisted wireless communications and cellular-connected UAVs, where UAVs are integrated into the network as new aerial communication platforms and users, respectively. Furthermore, we point out promising directions for future research. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Land levelling is one of the most energy-demanding steps in soil preparation. There are many limiting factors for a specific land levelling operation, such as fertile topsoil conservation, limited allowed slope, specific cut to fill ratio, etc. These limitations make optimisation problems of land levelling even more complicated. In this research, three computational and evolutionary methods including ICA, PSO, GA along with MLS were utilised as optimisation methods to minimise the soil cut and fill volumes and to determine the preferred levelling plane. The results indicated that ICA had the most efficient solution for the energy optimisation in the land levelling among the other investigated methods by saving 29% (17 GJ) of the total energy consumption compared with MLS. This study deals with optimising the energy consumption during land levelling projects using new computer-based techniques and compares them to the MLS method as a benchmark. All in all, ICA, PSO, and GA performed much better than MLS by saving 29, 17, and 10% of the total energy consumption in their best model (number 1 models), respectively. Nonetheless, with these great capacities for saving energy in developing countries, unfortunately, the lack of education and excess subsidies on fossil fuels nullify these potentials. © 2021 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

	abstract = {The suitable operating parameters of fluted roller metering mechanism need to be selected to address variability of application of inputs in a variable rate applicator. At present, the selection of operating parameters depends mainly on empirical rules and experimental trials. This paper presents the results of development and evaluation of multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting operating parameters of fluted roller metering mechanism of a variable rate applicator. The MLR and ANN models were developed to predict operating parameters viz. application rate, particle damage and particle distribution per unit area based on the data collected from experimental trials conducted under laboratory condition using fluted roller metering mechanism. The MLR models simulated the fluted roller exposed length with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 072, 0.65, 0.74 for urea, SSP and MOP fertilizers, respectively during training and 0.62, 0.54 and 0.59 for urea, SSP and MOP fertilizers, respectively during testing. The ANN model was optimized for 3–1–4 configuration with Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm, which indicated good performance during testing with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.60–0.84, 0.71–0.91, and 0.59–0.87 for granular SSP, urea and MOP fertilizer, respectively. The Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (E) for ANN training data set ranged 0.66–0.85, 0.71–0.92 and 0.61–0.85 for granular SSP, urea and MOP fertilizer, respectively. It was concluded that the ANN model predicted the operating parameters of the variable rate applicator better than MLR model with r2 value close 1. © 2019 Asian Agricultural and Biological Engineering Association},

	abstract = {In recent years, intelligent sensor techniques have achieved significant attention in agriculture. It is applied in agriculture to plan the several activities and missions properly by utilising limited resources with minor human interference. Currently, plant cultivation using new agriculture methods is very popular among the growers. However, the aeroponics is one of the methods of modern agriculture, which is commonly practiced around the world. In the system, plant cultivates under complete control conditions in the growth chamber by providing a small mist of the nutrient solution in replacement of the soil. The nutrient mist is ejected through atomization nozzles on a periodical basis. During the plant cultivation, several steps including temperature, humidity, light intensity, water nutrient solution level, pH and EC value, CO2 concentration, atomization time, and atomization interval time require proper attention for flourishing plant growth. Therefore, the object of this review study was to provide significant knowledge about early fault detection and diagnosis in aeroponics using intelligent techniques (wireless sensors). So, the farmer could monitor several paraments without using laboratory instruments, and the farmer could control the entire system remotely. Moreover, the technique also provides a wide range of information which could be essential for plant researchers and provides a greater understanding of how the key parameters of aeroponics correlate with plant growth in the system. It offers full control of the system, not by constant manual attention from the operator but to a large extent by wireless sensors. Furthermore, the adoption of the intelligent techniques in the aeroponic system could reduce the concept of the usefulness of the system due to complicated manually monitoring and controlling process. © 2018 Imran Ali Lakhiar et al.},

	abstract = {Elderly fall detection systems based on wireless body area sensor networks (WBSNs) have increased significantly in medical contexts. The power consumption of such systems is a critical issue influencing the overall practicality of the WBSN. Reducing the power consumption of these networks while maintaining acceptable performance poses a challenge. Several power reduction techniques can be employed to tackle this issue. A human vital signs monitoring system (HVSMS) has been proposed here to measure vital parameters of the elderly, including heart rate and fall detection based on heartbeat and accelerometer sensors, respectively. In addition, the location of elderly people can be determined based on Global Positioning System (GPS) and transmitted with their vital parameters to emergency medical centers (EMCs) via the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network. In this paper, the power consumption of the proposed HVSMS was minimized by merging a data-event (DE) algorithm and an energy-harvesting-technique-based wireless power transfer (WPT). The DE algorithm improved HVSMS power consumption, utilizing the duty cycle of the sleep/wake mode. The WPT successfully charged the HVSMS battery. The results demonstrated that the proposed DE algorithm reduced the current consumption of the HVSMS to 9.35 mA compared to traditional operation at 85.85 mA. Thus, an 89% power saving was achieved based on the DE algorithm and the battery life was extended to 30 days instead of 3 days (traditional operation). In addition, the WPT was able to charge the HVSMS batteries once every 30 days for 10 h, thus eliminating existing restrictions involving the use of wire charging methods. The results indicate that the HVSMS current consumption outperformed existing solutions from previous studies. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Hydraulic shock absorbers have come into widespread use in vehicle suspensions since decades ago to effectively reduce the acceleration of vehicle bodies and maintain good contact between tires and ground under road irregularities. Although energy efficiency has been a major concern in the automotive industry since the mass production in the 1900s, researchers realized that the energy dissipated in traditional hydraulic shock absorbers is worthy of being recovered only in the middle of 1990s. Since then, many different types of energy harvesting based shock absorbers were conceptualized and prototyped. Unlike traditional suspension systems which suppress the vibrations by dissipating the vibration energy into waste heat, the regenerative suspension with energy harvesting shock absorbers can convert the traditionally wasted energy into electricity. This paper is a comprehensive review on energy harvesting based vehicle suspensions. Specifically, it focuses on an analytical and statistical study of the vehicle regenerative suspensions and reviewing the concepts, designs, simulations, test rig experiments and vehicle road tests. The most common energy harvesting systems in vehicle suspensions are compared in terms of advantages and limitations.

These wearables are small IoT devices capable of sensing, storing, processing, and exchanging data to assist users by improving their everyday life tasks through various applications. However, the IoWT has also brought new challenges for the research community to address such as increasing demand for enhanced computational power, better communication capabilities, improved security and privacy features, reduced form factor, minimal weight, and better comfort. Most wearables are battery-powered devices that need to be recharged - therefore, the limited battery life remains the bottleneck leading to the need to enhance the energy efficiency of wearables, thus, becoming an active research area. This paper presents a survey of energy-efficient solutions proposed for diverse IoWT applications by following the systematic literature review method. The available techniques published from 2010 to 2020 are scrutinized, and the taxonomy of the available solutions is presented based on the targeted application area. Moreover, a comprehensive qualitative analysis compares the proposed studies in each application area in terms of their advantages, disadvantages, and main contributions. Furthermore, a list of the most significant performance parameters is provided. A more in-depth discussion of the main techniques to enhance wearables' energy efficiency is presented by highlighting the trade-offs involved.

	abstract = {In this paper, a comprehensive review of the sensing technologies, capabilities and requirements in the energy-water nexus is presented considering the interdependence of variables in the interconnected energy and water sectors. Conventional sensor technologies that are used in the energy and water sectors of today are critiqued from the perspectives of accuracy, weight, volume, power consumption, commercial availability, data storage capabilities, ability to communicate with established electronic interfaces and portability of operation for remote sensing. The impacts of having multiple parameters, indefinite variables and/or unresolved dependencies in sensing energy usage for water applications and in sensing water usage for energy applications have been investigated. The paper also reviews innovative research developments on sensor technologies in the energy-water nexus that are based on bio-technology, nano-technology and wireless networks and that could possibly resolve sensing challenges such as the interdependencies of variables in the energy-water nexus. In addition, a network of sensor technologies that are most appropriate to each sector in the nexus is presented to improve the operational efficiency of the energy-water nexus. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the increasing global demand for fresh food, the importance of the mass agri-producing countries has also increased. Agri-production has undergone a significant transformation from traditional practices to precise practices with the help of new technologies such as the IoT, big data, and GIS. However, the impact of such precision on the overall supply chain is insufficient due to the low adaptability of these expensive technologies. Fuzzy logic, known for being able to handle uncertainty in different fields of science and technology, may be able to address the highly uncertain factors of the agri-supply chain, such as the soil content, rainfall, humidity, and production and yield prediction. Thus, this study reviews fuzzy applications in the agri-supply chain considering land suitability, production techniques, irrigation, cold storage deficiencies, transportation, waste management, environmental and sustainability issues, and drought management and establishes an integrated framework. The integrated framework, which aims to analyse the overall supply chain performance, finally concludes that there is a lack of efficient knowledge-based models in the domain. Thus, using collaborative fuzzy applications with big data and GIS with a higher degree of heuristic and meta-heuristic simulations in the agri-supply chain can develop more robust models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

As a result, there is a growing need for online monitoring and Fault Detection, or to identify system faults to improve reliability. Accordingly, it is viable to apply the preliminary signs and to prevent the system from stopping and the occurrence of a catastrophe to a large extent.

	abstract = {The technology development in wireless sensor network (WSN) offers a sustainable solution towards precision agriculture (PA) in greenhouses. It helps to effectively use the agricultural resources and management tools and monitors different parameters to attain better quality yield and production. WSN makes use of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), a wireless technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. LoRaWAN is one of the most successful LPWAN technologies despite its low data rate and because of its low deployment and management costs. Greenhouses are susceptible to different types of interference and diversification, demanding an improved WSN design scheme. In this paper, we contemplate the viable challenges for PA in greenhouses and propose the successive steps essential for effectual WSN deployment and facilitation. We performed a real-time, end-to-end deployment of a LoRaWAN-based sensor network in a greenhouse of the ’Proefcentrum Hoogstraten’ research center in Belgium. We have designed a dashboard for better visualization and analysis of the data, analyzed the power consumption for the LoRaWAN communication, and tried three different enclosure types (commercial, simple box and airflow box, respectively). We validated the implications of real-word challenges on the end-to-end deployment and air circulation for the correct sensor readings. We found that temperature and humidity have a larger impact on the sensor readings inside the greenhouse than we initially thought, which we successfully solved through the airflow box design. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Forest industry corporations use quality management systems in their wood procurement operations. Spatial quality data are used to improve the quality of wood harvesting and to achieve environmental sustainability. Some studies have proposed new management systems based on LiDAR. The main aim of this study was to investigate how efficiently planning systems can select areas for wood harvesting a priori with respect to avoiding harvesting damage caused by forest machinery. A literature review revealed the possibility of using GISs, and case studies showed the criteria required to predict the required quality levels. Terrestrial LiDAR can be utilized in authorities’ quality control systems, but it is inefficient for preplanning without terrestrial gamma-ray data collection. Airborne LiDAR and gamma-ray information about forest soils can only be used for planning larger regions at the forest level because the information includes too much uncertainty to allow it to be used for planning in small-sized areas before wood harvesting operations involving wood procurement. In addition, airborne LiDAR is not accurate enough, even at the forest level, for the planning of wood procurement systems because wood harvesting remains challenging without field measurements. Therefore, there is a need for the use of manual ground-penetrating radar for determining the peat layer thickness and the depth to the groundwater table. © 2021 by the authors.},

Being a fierce predator, having no natural predator, being adaptive to different habitats, and being with high reproduction rates, the red lionfish has enervated current endeavors to control their population. This paper focuses on the first steps to reinforce these efforts by employing autonomous vehicles. To that end, an assistive underwater robotic scheme is designed to aid spear-hunting divers to locate and more efficiently hunt the lionfish. A small-sized, open source ROV with an integrated camera is programmed using Deep Learning methods to detect red lionfish in real time. Dives are restricted to a certain depth range, time, and air supply. The ROV program is designed to allow the divers to locate the red lionfish before each dive, so that they can plan their hunt to maximize their catch. Lightweight, portability, user-friendly interface, energy efficiency, and low cost of maintenance are some advantages of the proposed scheme. The developed system's performance is examined in areas currently invaded by the red lionfish in the Gulf of Mexico. The ROV has shown success in detecting the red lionfish with high confidence in real time. © 2018 M-Mahdi Naddaf-Sh et al.},

	abstract = {One of the most difficult practical problems to overcome when testing agricultural machines (tractors) at the dyno is measuring the fuel consumption and assessing the engine's global efficiency. Indeed, diesel engines have two fuel-lines: a delivery line (from the tank to the cylinders), and a return line, to convey back in the tank the fuel not injected as a consequence of the accelerator position and pump settings. In principle, to measure the consumption, known the delivery flowrate (proportional to the engine speed), a single flowmeter could be used in the return line only (having a variable flow); unluckily, the real suction flowrate is generally unknown, varying with the model and vehicle age (i.e., with the pump components' wear), so two flowmeters are always needed. But there is another metrological problem to consider: a flowmeter inserted in series in a fuel-supply line could significantly alter the flowrate. Finally, another further problem can arise, when the experimenters are asked to characterize machines not owned by them: modifications to the vehicle under test should be avoided or, at least, limited, e.g., not to void the guarantee. Unfortunately, solutions like the clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters (placed outside the pipes) are not so suitable for fluids with few particles in suspension, e.g., the fuel processed by the pump. Therefore, it was decided to act upstream of the entire supply line, providing an external tank placed on a precision scale near the tractor, to be used instead of the vehicle's tank. The only, absolutely reversible, needed operation is to connect to the fuel pump two flexible pipes drawing from the external tank. The device gives the net fuel consumption by means of a data logger that acquires the tank mass at periodic intervals. It has been successfully tested on a New Holland 4020V tractor at the dyno, allowing to calculate the instant/hourly/specific consumptions and the engine's global efficiency at six engine speeds (from 800 to 2200 rpm) and full throttle. © 2018 Latvia University of Agriculture.

	abstract = {Activity data from 79 line-haul and vocational trucks were analyzed to estimate trip-averaged fuel consumption per distance driven and per work performed. The 79 trucks had engine model years ranging from 2008 to 2015 and average (±standard deviation) miles per gallon of 5.5 ± 1.7, which is comparable to other large fleet studies. Engine output work used to overcome various forms of resistance was minimized at vehicle speeds between 54 and 60 mph, which led to best fuel economy. The average gallons-per-brake horsepower-hour (gal/BHP-HR) was 0.058 ± 0.0085. When comparing the gal/BHP-HR per trip speed, higher average trip speeds led to improved fuel economy (lower gal/BHP-HR). In the case of out-of-state line-haul trucks, fuel economy was also dependent on model year. The newer model year out-of-state line-haul truck (2014) had a significant improvement in fuel economy compared with the older model year trucks (2012 and 2013). This could be the result of more stringent CO2 emission standards beginning for model year 2014 trucks under the Phase 1 Greenhouse Gas rule, but data on more vehicles would further corroborate this. The trip-averaged CO2 emissions were calculated for each truck and it was found that some truck groups displayed consistent trip-averaged emissions whereas others displayed high variability despite belonging to the same fleet. Several of the trucks engaged in significant idling, with a median contribution to their CO2 emissions of 4.2%. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the daily transportation modes of an individual provides useful information in many application domains, such as urban design, real-time journey recommendation, and providing location-based services. In existing systems, accelerometer and GPS are the dominantly used signal sources for transportation context monitoring which drain out the limited battery life of the wearable devices very quickly. To resolve the high energy consumption issue, in this paper, we present EnTrans, which enables transportation mode detection by using only the kinetic energy harvester as an energy-efficient signal source. The proposed idea is based on the intuition that the vibrations experienced by the passenger during traveling with different transportation modes are distinctive. Thus, voltage signal generated by the energy harvesting devices should contain sufficient features to distinguish different transportation modes. We evaluate our system using over 28 h of data, which is collected by eight individuals using a practical energy harvesting prototype. The evaluation results demonstrate that EnTrans is able to achieve an overall accuracy over 92% in classifying five different modes while saving more than 34% of the system power compared to conventional accelerometer-based approaches.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agricultural production finds itself in an area of tension. As a critical infrastructure, it has the task of reliably feeding a growing global population and supplying it with energy. However, the negative environmental impacts caused by agriculture, such as the global loss of biodiversity and the emission of greenhouse gases, are to be reduced. The increasing use of digital technologies is often described as a panacea that enables sustainable agriculture. The relevant literature is very dynamic, but the large number of concepts and terminologies used makes it difficult to obtain an overall view. In addition, many contributions focus on presumed or modeled efficiency gains, but this ignores technical and societal prerequisites and barriers. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify the opportunities and risks of smart farming (SF) for more ecological arable farming. For this purpose, a holistic and environmental view was taken. The potential of SF to aid in the reduction in the environmental impacts of individual agricultural work steps was examined via an analysis of current literature. In addition, rebound effects, acceptance barriers and political omissions were considered as risks that prevent the benefits from being realized. It was shown that SF is able to contribute to a significant reduction in the negative environmental effects of agriculture. In particular, a reduction in fertilizer and pesticide application rates through mapping, sensing and precise application can lead to environmental benefits. However, achieving this requires the minimization of existing risks. For this reason, a proactive role of the state is required, implementing the necessary governance measures. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The next generation's sensor nodes will be more intelligent, energy conservative, and perpetual lifetime in the set-up of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These sensors nodes are facing the overwhelming challenge of energy consumption which gradually decreases the lifetime of overall network. The wireless power transfer (WPT) is one of the most emerging technologies of energy harvesting that deploys at the heart of sensor nodes for efficient lifetime solution. A wireless portable charging device (WPCD) is drifting inside the WSN to recharge all the nodes which are questing for the eternal life. In this paper, we aspire to optimize a multi-objective function for charging trail of WPCD, and self-learning algorithm for data routing jointly. We formulated that the objective functions can optimize the fair energy consumption as well as maximize the routing efficiency of WPCD. The fundamental challenge of the problem is, to integrate the novel path for WPCD by applying the Nodal A∗ algorithm. We proposed a novel method of sensor node's training for intellectual data transmission by using of clustering and reinforcement learning (SARSA) defined as clustering SARSA (C-SARSA) along with an optimal solution of objective functions. The whole mechanism outperforms in terms of trade-off between energy consumption and stability (fair energy consumption among all nodes) of the WSN; moreover, it prolongs the lifetime of the WSN. The simulated results demonstrate that our proposed method did better than compared literature in terms of energy consumption, stability, and lifetime of the WSN. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study was devoted to introducing and experimenting a new waste-derived oxygenated additive, i.e., ethylene glycol diacetate on performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends. Mineral diesel and its blends with 5 and 20 vol% biodiesel were used in the engine test runs. These fuel blends were doped with ethylene glycol diacetate at three volumetric levels in the range of 1–3%. The engine was run under engine load conditions varying from idle to full load operation at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. Overall, the most appealing results were obtained when diesel fuel dosed with 3 vol% ethylene glycol diacetate was combusted under moderate engine load conditions. This oxygenated fuel blend could result in a significant mitigation in both nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions but could lead to an unfavorable increase in unburned hydrocarbon emissions in comparison with the additive-free diesel fuel. More specifically, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 1.9–4.3 and 1.6–3.1 times, respectively, while unburned hydrocarbon emissions for the selected fuel blend under moderate engine loads were increased by 1.9–3.6 times. The carbon monoxide emission for this fuel blend was comparable with that of neat diesel. Furthermore, the significant reductions in nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions were achieved with a trivial drop in brake thermal efficiency of the engine (≈5%). As a conclusion, the developed oxygenated additive could be used for reformulating diesel fuel with the aim of substantially mitigating nitrogen oxides emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {During the last decades, the art and science of fuzzy logic have witnessed significant developments and have found applications in many active areas, such as pattern recognition, classification, control systems, etc. A lot of research has demonstrated the ability of fuzzy logic in dealing with vague and uncertain linguistic information. For the purpose of representing human perception, fuzzy logic has been employed as an effective tool in intelligent decision making. Due to the emergence of various studies on fuzzy logic-based decision-making methods, it is necessary to make a comprehensive overview of published papers in this field and their applications. This paper covers a wide range of both theoretical and practical applications of fuzzy logic in decision making. It has been grouped into five parts: to explain the role of fuzzy logic in decision making, we first present some basic ideas underlying different types of fuzzy logic and the structure of the fuzzy logic system. Then, we make a review of evaluation methods, prediction methods, decision support algorithms, group decision-making methods based on fuzzy logic. Applications of these methods are further reviewed. Finally, some challenges and future trends are given from different perspectives. This paper illustrates that the combination of fuzzy logic and decision making method has an extensive research prospect. It can help researchers to identify the frontiers of fuzzy logic in the field of decision making. © 2021. by the authors. Licensee Agora University, Oradea, Romania.

	abstract = {Software Defined Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (SDWRSNs) are an inexorable trend for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), including Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Network (WRSNs). However, the traditional network devices cannot be completely substituted in the short term. Hybrid SDWRSNs, where software defined devices and traditional devices coexist, will last for a long time. Hybrid SDWRSNs bring new challenges as well as opportunities for energy saving issues, which is still a key problem considering that the wireless chargers are also exhaustible, especially in some rigid environment out of the main supply. Numerous energy saving schemes for WSNs, or even some works for WRSNs, are no longer suitable for the new features of hybrid SDWRSNs. To solve this problem, this paper puts forward an Energy-saving Traffic Scheduling (ETS) algorithm. The ETS algorithm adequately considers the new characters in hybrid SDWRSNs, and takes advantage of the Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller’s direct control ability on SDN nodes and indirect control ability on normal nodes. The simulation results show that, comparing with traditional Minimum Transmission Energy (MTE) protocol, ETS can substantially improve the energy efficiency in hybrid SDWRSNs for up to 20–40% while ensuring feasible data delay. © 2017 by the authors.

	abstract = {Measuring the performance of the compression-ignition internal combustion engine of agricultural machines (in particular, the torque delivered instantaneously) is an essential requirement for monitoring: (a) the exploitation of the engine mechanical-energy potential (in terms of generated torque) and (b) its correct operation (in terms of global efficiency, fuel consumption and possible ageing). Due to the many important technical and economic implications, the instant acquisition of the engine torque is therefore a critical point in any operational monitoring system, as well as in predictive maintenance models. Torque measurement is by no means a simple task, especially in old agricultural machines lacking of default data acquisition devices/on-board electronics, and many critical issues arise from the fact that it involves rotating components (shafts), which are often difficult to be accessed. For this reason, an indirect torque measurement methodology, based on a predictive model relying on the exhaust gas temperature, is preferable. An accurate measurement of temperature data is of primary importance to precisely calculate the torque, which means performing an accurate thermocouple choice, placement, and data elaboration. This is made even more challenging by the fact that the temperature of the exhaust gas is often in a transient state due to variable engine regime necessary for machine operation. The study presented here illustrates some considerations about the trend and the equation of the experimental measurements of the exhaust gas temperature, considering three different positions for the thermocouples on the exhaust line, and proposes an optimal technical solution in terms of sensitivity and promptness of response. © 2021 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

	abstract = {The sea surface monitoring is playing an important role in obtaining the ocean big data, especially for some businesses requiring complete coverage (e.g. the marine search and rescue). A great deal of energy consumption caused by observation leads to that the energy supply is more precious than the traditional observations. This study considers the problem of the energy allocation of sea-based observation (SOEA) to develop the energy conservation of sea surface monitoring. A b-Matching-based Area Division (BMAD) model is proposed to quantitatively define and analyze the SOEA problem. It reveals that SOEA is the b-matching problem of directed bipartite network. Three kinds of constraints are analyzed: the degree constraints mirroring the qualities of observations, the continuity constraint restricting the voidage of observation, and the conflict constraint addressing the interference between platforms. The objective and constraints are integratedly defined as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, the optimum solution to which can be obtained by a proposed ILP algorithm. The solution can provide the approach to handling plenty of observation missions by the limited energy and tells the energy quota at least for the observation missions. The experimental evaluation shows that BMAD provides the effective planning of observation missions based on the limited energy and tells the energy reserve at least for observation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study reports on the results of gaseous pollutants emission measurements of double-decker buses in an urban road network, using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). Measured vehicles were tested by following in-service buses on regular routes. Six Euro II and Euro III buses were retrofitted with diesel particulate filters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or a combined SCR+DPF (SCRT) device. Substantial and statistically significant technology impacts were observed for several pollutants. Optimized SCR and SCRT retrofit technology reduced real-world NOx emissions by approximately 70%, on average. Retrofit DPF slightly reduced NOx emissions but increased direct NO2 emissions by more than a factor of 8, on average. SCRT led to about 70% lower NO2 levels than DPF alone, but for some vehicles higher NO2 levels were observed as compared with the "no retrofit" situation, warranting further investigation. None of the SCR systems were found to lead to a substantial increase in NH3 emissions after operation optimization. High NH3 and N2O emissions were occasionally observed while experience with the system calibration was being accumulated. Observed average N2O emission levels for "DPF+SCR" technology were relatively high at 182 mg/kg fuel, corresponding to 1.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The study shows that SCR retrofit programs can be effective for NOx reduction of transit buses but that proper calibration and regular emission monitoring are required.

	abstract = {Bioenergy is widely considered a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, large-scale applications of biomass-based energy products are limited due to challenges related to feedstock variability, conversion economics, and supply chain reliability. Artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging concept, has been applied to bioenergy systems in recent decades to address those challenges. This paper reviewed 164 articles published between 2005 and 2019 that applied different AI techniques to bioenergy systems. This review focuses on identifying the unique capabilities of various AI techniques in addressing bioenergy-related research challenges and improving the performance of bioenergy systems. Specifically, we characterized AI studies by their input variables, output variables, AI techniques, dataset size, and performance. We examined AI applications throughout the life cycle of bioenergy systems. We identified four areas in which AI has been mostly applied, including (1) the prediction of biomass properties, (2) the prediction of process performance of biomass conversion, including different conversion pathways and technologies, (3) the prediction of biofuel properties and the performance of bioenergy end-use systems, and (4) supply chain modeling and optimization. Based on the review, AI is particularly useful in generating data that are hard to be measured directly, improving traditional models of biomass conversion and biofuel end-uses, and overcoming the challenges of traditional computing techniques for bioenergy supply chain design and optimization. For future research, efforts are needed to develop standardized and practical procedures for selecting AI techniques and determining training data samples, to enhance data collection, documentation, and sharing across bioenergy-related areas, and to explore the potential of AI in supporting the sustainable development of bioenergy systems from holistic perspectives. © 2021 The Authors.

Results demonstrate that energy savings by applying MOGA and DEA in planted farms are 20.90% and 8.52%, respectively whilst the corresponding values in ratoon farms are 2.61% and 13.90%, respectively. The increase of energy use efficiency is mainly attributed to electricity, diesel fuel, human labor and nitrogen fertilizer in sugarcane production (planted and ratoon). Furthermore, most environmental impacts under MOGA condition are considerably lower than those under DEA, which are in turn less than the present conditions for both farms (planted and ratoon). The largest variations between MOGA and DEA are on terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidation in planted farms and ratoon farms, respectively. MOGA is a feasible OT to assign the best input combinations for planted and ratoon sugarcane productions, by reducing environmental impacts and simultaneously enhancing farms productivity and energy use efficiency. Results are useful to authorities in making decision regarding sustainable expansion of sugarcane production in Iran. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biodiesel has the potential to significantly contribute to making transportation fuels more sustainable. Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of processes for biodiesel production and use, fast and accurate modeling tools are required for their design, optimization, monitoring, and control. Data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated superior predictive capability compared to conventional methods for modeling such highly complex processes. Among the available ML techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) technology is the most widely used approach in biodiesel research. The ANN approach is a computational learning method that mimics the human brain's neurological processing ability to map input-output relationships of ill-defined systems. Given its high generalization capacity, ANN has gained popularity in dealing with complex nonlinear real-world engineering and scientific problems. This paper is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing various ML technology applications, with a particular focus on ANN, to solve function approximation, optimization, monitoring, and control problems in biodiesel research. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using ML technology in biodiesel research are highlighted to direct future R&D efforts in this domain. ML technology has generally been used in biodiesel research for modeling (trans)esterification processes, physico-chemical characteristics of biodiesel, and biodiesel-fueled internal combustion engines. The primary purpose of introducing ML technology to the biodiesel industry has been to monitor and control biodiesel systems in real-time; however, these issues have rarely been explored in the literature. Therefore, future studies appear to be directed towards the use of ML techniques for real-time process monitoring and control of biodiesel systems to enhance production efficiency, economic viability, and environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Very well into the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0), humankind can hardly distinguish between what is artificial and what is natural (e.g., man-made virus and natural virus). Thus, the level of discombobulation among people, companies, or countries is indeed unprecedented. The fact that industry 4.0 is explosively disrupting or retrofitting each and every industrial sector makes industry 4.0 the famous buzzword amongst researchers today. However, the insight of industry 4.0 disruption into the industrial sectors remains ill-defined in both academic and nonacademic literature. The present study aimed at identifying industry 4.0 neologisms, understanding the industry 4.0 disruption and illustrating the disruptive technology convergence in the major industrial sectors. A total of 99 neologisms of industry 4.0 were identified. Industry 4.0 disruption in the education industry (education 4.0), energy industry (energy 4.0), agriculture industry (agriculture 4.0), healthcare industry (healthcare 4.0), and logistics industry (logistics 4.0) was described. The convergence of 12 disruptive technologies including 3D printing, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, big data, blockchain, cloud computing, drones, Internet of Things, nanotechnology, robotics, simulation, and synthetic biology in agriculture, healthcare, and logistics industries was illustrated. The study divulged the need for extensive research to expand the application areas of the disruptive technologies in the industrial sectors.  © 2020 Ocident Bongomin et al.},

	abstract = {The advancement of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things (IoT) to scoop out untapped information and communication technology opportunities. It is anticipated that IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices to deliver plenty of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make our life more resourceful but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Consequently, there is a high demand for green communication to reduce energy consumption, which requires optimal resource availability and controlled power levels. In contrast to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources - memory, power, and computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to the need for efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics such as the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices spread over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such as LoRa and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the users. However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base station) that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed technology, narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology presents a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics like enhanced indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view of IoT and NBIoT, subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and energy-efficiency techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the NBIoT path to success are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel energy-efficient techniques 'zonal thermal pattern analysis' and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system have been proposed towards green IoT. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {5G has taken off at a brisk speed over the years, bringing significant benefits to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wireless sensor nodes. The launching of 5G technology provides an excellent opportunity for the faster development of smart cities. Nanogenerators (NGs) have been widely demonstrated as sustainable power sources and self-powered active sensors. The last 15 years of research on NGs have revealed that it can contribute to the digitalization of smart city services, such as localized renewable energy supplies, intelligent transportation, smart vehicles, and digital healthcare applications. The integration of novel NG technology in smart cities will solve problems pertinent to sustainable power sources for decentralized IoT devices and provide pathways for realizing self-powered active sensing systems. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive review of current research on NGs’ applications in different sectors of a smart city. More importantly, we will show how NGs can be a game changer in the development of smart cities under 5G services and how the usage of NGs can boost the convenience of city dwellers. Our aim is to draw more attention to NG applications in the digitalization of smart cities and provide a guideline for applying smart concepts in future urban planning. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

In recent years, advances in agricultural machinery and the emergence of agricultural robots continuously increased the resolution at which differentiated treatment is possible. This creates a corresponding need for information at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Autonomous multi-robot systems (e.g., unmanned ground and aerial vehicles) are some of the most promising approaches for such information collection in open-air farms.

	abstract = {For rechargeable wireless sensor nodes, effective power management is of prime importance because of the stochastic behaviour of the environmental resources. A key issue in integrating solar resources with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the need of precise irradiance measurements and power to resource modelling. WSNs are employed in an adhoc manner comprises of numerous sensing nodes and organised as a network for the sake of checking and balancing the environmental factors. Each node has sensing, computation, communication, and locomotion capabilities but operates with limited battery life. Energy harvesting is a way of powering these WSNs by harvesting energy from the environment. By considering harvested energy as an energy source, certain considerations are different from that of battery-operated networks. Nondeterministic energy availability with respect to time is the reason behind these differences, which put a limit on the maximum rate at which energy can be used. Thus, reliable knowledge of solar radiation is essential for informed design, deployment planning, and optimal management of energy in rechargeable WSNs. Further, power management is essential in self-powerssed networks to efficiently utilize the available energy. In this paper, a detailed survey on different solar forecasting techniques has been presented for precise energy estimates. A detailed study on energy efficient power management techniques is also proposed to address the feasibility of energy-harvesting approach in WSNs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Rice farmers in the Mekong Delta are not only experiencing challenges due to climate change but are also expected to increase production through sustainable intensification. Increased production and mechanization, such as using combine harvesters leave farmers with more rice straw in the field, which farmers often choose to burn resulting in adverse health effects, increased air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Farmer adoption of recently promoted sustainable rice straw management practices is low. The present study, therefore, investigated factors influencing the acceptance of different rice straw management practices. 111 smallholder rice farmers participated in the study. Farmers’ perceptions of risks, benefits and their acceptance of eight different rice straw management practices including burning, soil incorporation, composting, mushroom and biogas production, and different collection methods, was investigated via a survey questionnaire. Results show that farmers often burn their rice straw even though they perceive high risks, few benefits and expressed low levels of acceptance for rice straw burning. Acceptance of rice straw management practices differs between practices; however, benefit perceptions are the strongest predictor for all practices followed by knowledge about climate change. Risk perceptions were a weak predictor for some practices including burning and biogas production. The regression models explain up to 50% of the variance. Results show that the experiential system determines farmers’ perception of practiced straw management options. This study also shows that even though climate change is not psychologically distant to farmers, sustainable behavior will depend on the acceptability, feasibility and perceived benefit of options provided. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Nowadays, accurate measurement and providing 3D information of the tree at a low cost is necessary to manage the growth and yield of the forest. Remote Sensing (RS) methods can replace the efficiency of traditional fieldbased forest inventory methods. The RS method using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (DAP) is now increasingly popular in forest inventory. This study utilized both individual tree detection method LiDAR and DAP and area-based approach (ABA) open forest data (OFD)from the Finnish forest centre to estimate tree attributes in the young forest. The result shows a strong correlation between LiDAR and DAP; both have a reasonable correlation with OFD. UAV DAP or area-based approach OFD could be the best alternative to UAV LiDAR considering cost-effectiveness in forest inventory. However, further study in the more significant and larger area should be further investigated to select the best options in forest inventory. © 2021, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

The current advances in remote sensing and the availability of high resolution, high frequency, and free Sentinel-2 images improve the implementation of Precision Agriculture (PA) for a wider range of farmers. This study investigated the possibility of using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 images and machine learning techniques to assess corn (Zea mays) grain yield spatial variability within the field scale. A 22-ha study field in North Italy was monitored between 2016 and 2018; corn yield was measured and recorded by a grain yield monitor mounted on the harvester machine recording more than 20,000 georeferenced yield observation points from the study field for each season. VIs from a total of 34 Sentinel-2 images at different crop ages were analyzed for correlation with the measured yield observations. Multiple regression and two different machine learning approaches were also tested to model corn grain yield. The three main results were the following: (i) the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) provided the highest R2 value of 0.48 for monitoring within-field variability of corn grain yield; (ii) the most suitable period for corn yield monitoring was a crop age between 105 and 135 days from the planting date (R4-R6); (iii) Random Forests was the most accurate machine learning approach for predicting within-field variability of corn yield, with an R2 value of almost 0.6 over an independent validation set of half of the total observations. Based on the results, within-field variability of corn yield for previous seasons could be investigated from archived Sentinel-2 data with GNDVI at crop stage (R4-R6). © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Crop production varies spatially and temporally within the field boundaries depending on soil and environmental conditions. The major concern of variability for agronomic inputs addresses how best to intervene in the right place, at the right time and in the right quantity to improve the potential yield of crops and feedstock. This book addresses the important question of how large a role bioproduction and renewable energy can play in achieving sustainable agricultural practices in the present system of agricultural production. Agronomy is local, which brings the challenges to the remote optimization of agricultural machinery operations for seeding, fertilizing, crop protecting, and harvesting in the field level to adopt precise agriculture technologies. Cloud computing and big data analytics bring the potential about in machine optimization and agronomy to enable the site-specific management. Understanding bioproduction engineering and development can help improve the efficiency of a sustainable agriculture system. With the aim of understanding this process, this book focuses on bioproduction and sustainability issues, covering sensors, agricultural decision-making systems and the relationship between bioproduction and sustainable practices of agriculture. The chapters are organized as follows: information oriented technology that can be implemented to address the variability of bioproduction systems, sensors and control systems, precision agricultural technology, decision support systems in agriculture, renewable energy resources and analytical hierarchy processes for agricultural management. The crop growth monitoring parameters like LAI and NDVI points were clarified in the pre-processing stage of images. The decisions and logistics that influence the market prices of agricultural products is emphasized within the revised edition of this book. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of recent developments in remote and proximal sensing technologies and their basic applicability to various aspects of forest operations. It categorises these applications according to the technologies used and considers their deployment platform in terms of their being space-, airborne or terrestrial. For each combination of technology and application, a brief review of the state-of-the-art has been described from the literature, ranging from the measurement of forests and single trees, the derivation of landscape scale terrain models down to micro-topographic soil disturbance modelling, through infrastructure planning, construction and maintenance, to forest accessibility with ground and cable based harvesting systems. The review then goes on to discuss how these technologies and applications contribute to reducing impacts on forest soils, cultural heritage sites and other areas of special value or interest, after which sensors and methods necessary in autonomous navigation and the use of computer vision on forest machines are discussed. The review concludes that despite the many promising or demonstrated applications of remotely or proximately sensed data in forest operations, almost all are still experimental and have a range of issues that need to be addressed or improved upon before widespread operationalization can take place. © 2017, University of Zagreb.

	abstract = {Radio-frequency (RF)-powered energy harvesting systems have offered new perspectives in various scientific and clinical applications such as health monitoring, bio-signal acquisition, and battery-less data-transceivers. In such applications, an RF rectifier with high sensitivity, high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is critical to enable the utilization of the ambient RF signal power. In this paper, we explore the high PCE advantage of the steep-slope III-V heterojunction tunnel field-effect transistor (HTFET) RF rectifiers over the Si FinFET baseline design for RF-powered battery-less systems. We investigate the device characteristics of HTFETs to improve the sensitivity and PCE of the RF rectifiers. Different topologies including the two-transistor (2-T) and four-transistor (4-T) complementary-HTFET designs, and the n-type HTFET-only designs are evaluated with design parameter optimizations to achieve high PCE and high sensitivity. The performance evaluation of the optimized 4-T cross-coupled HTFET rectifier has shown an over 50% PCE with an RF input power ranging from-40 dBm to-25 dBm, which significantly extends the RF input power range compared to the baseline Si FinFET design. A maximum PCE of 84% and 85% has been achieved in the proposed 4-T N-HTFET-only rectifier at-33.7 dBm input power and the 4-T cross-coupled HTFET rectifier at-34.5 dBm input power, respectively. The capability of obtaining a high PCE at a low RF input power range reveals the superiority of the HTFET RF rectifiers for battery-less energy harvesting applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Timber harvesting operations vary greatly around the world, as do the adaptations of technology to the complex, locally variable conditions. Similarly, technological innovations occur as a response to a large number of different situations. This review examines the three main drivers considered to generate substantial technological change in mechanized timber harvesting: 1) availability of new technology, 2) demand for new products and 3) introduction of new regulations. The main focus is on Nordic cut-to-length harvesting using a harvester and forwarder, partly due to its advanced level of technology and partly due to the authors’ backgrounds. Examining new technology, progress towards increased automation is highlighted with examples of entry-level products that provide computer-assisted motion control and semiautomation. Examples of unmanned machines and other high-level automation are also presented. Innovations in the field of bioenergy harvesting are presented as examples of advances addressing the demand for new products. Thus, illustrations span from harvesting of tree parts other than stemwood, to how such harvesting and transportation can be integrated into the traditional stemwood harvest. The impact of new regulations on technological innovation is demonstrated with advances aimed at reducing soil damage. Examples range from technical solutions for reducing soil pressure, to walking, flying and even climbing machines. Some predictions are given as to when certain advances can be expected to become reality. However, even though the main drivers are likely to change timber harvesting with new products and new rules, they will probably do so through a continued adaptation of technology to local needs. © 2017, University of Zagreb.

Firstly, the curve fitting method was used to determine the dynamic sampling periods of the sensor nodes at different times of a day under typical weather conditions. Then the minimum depth sleeping scheduling mechanism was used for sensor nodes located at different depths in the monitoring network according to constructed topology structure of the monitoring network. Finally, the simulation of operating energy consumption and lifetime of the monitoring network was carried out based on the operating characteristics of monitoring network and node's energy consumption model. The simulation results show that the minimum depth sleeping scheduling mechanism of dynamic sampling period can effectively reduce the nodes' energy consumption, prolong the lifetime of the monitoring network of distributed PV systems. © 2016, Science Press.

Thanks to this system, it is possible to collect and synchronize the data coming from the test stand and from several other sensors equipping the motors under test: a load cell used in a chrono-gravimetric fuel consumption system, many thermocouples, a lambda probe, an exhaust gas analyser. To have a better control of the position of the throttling valve during the trials (hence a higher repeatability), a control system, based on an Arduino board, directly acts on the valve through a servomotor. Then, a series of software tools allows the interfacing of the various devices and the automatic post-processing of the acquired data (filtering of signals, recognition of data corresponding to the single engine speeds, time-averaging). The described testing equipment and the implemented procedures allow investigating, on the whole operating range of a motor (i.e., at different engine speeds and loads), each single performance parameter's value, such as: the torque, the power, the fuel consumption of the motor, the temperature and the composition of the exhausts (up to nine different gases), the temperature of the engine head and of the cylinder block, the combustion quality and many other additional parameters describing the engine performance.

Agricultural operations such as crop spraying and water management require rigorous monitoring of crops in order to identify the correct time to spray and irrigate the crops.

Advancement in computer processing speed and algorithms has made it possible to devise such strategies to optimize several agricultural operations. One of those operations is to spray crops with pesticides and monitor crops. This requires an airborne vehicle which can monitor and spray crops efficiently. Several optimization techniques have been used in recent years to optimize the path of the aerial vehicle due to limited fuel carrying capability of these vehicles as well as the increasing cost of fuel. A comparative study has been made in this paper to analyze the performance of some of the leading techniques used to optimize agricultural operations in recent years.},

	abstract = {The awareness of the importance of plants in the human diet has developed into detailed scientific study. The role of plants in medicine seems to have always been known and even today searches are being constantly made to find chemicals in plants that can be used to prevent or cure disease in modern medicine. A vast range of plant species have been eaten throughout the history of mankind. Presumably, initially human beings started using plants and their products from gathering them in the wild and eventually finding ways of cultivating them. This is the history of the development of agriculture. Even now people are still collecting plants for food from the wild in tandem with the development of breeding new cultivars of these crops and improvedways of cultivating them. Keller and Tukuitonga (2007) stated that 'Low fruit and vegetable intake was identified as an important risk factor for chronic diseases in the WHO World Health Report 2002. Overall, it is estimated that up to 2.7 million lives could potentially be saved each year if fruit and vegetable consumption was sufficiently increased.'The nutritional properties of vegetables and fruit have been known for centuries. In the 18th century a French pharmacist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier demonstrated, for several years by his own diet, that all the nutrients required to sustain a healthy life were found in potatoes (Block 2008). The quality of the plantmaterial in terms of nutrition and the maintenance of that quality and reducing their physical losses from harvest to reaching the consumer have been the subject of a vast number of research projects. Changes that can occur may be due to infections by microorganisms or by the physiological processes that continue in vegetables and fruit since they are still living organismswith life processes that are severed from their sources of renewal and sustenance. © 2015 by JohnWiley & Sons, Ltd.

Secondly, two modeling approaches which are partial least-square regression (PLSR) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) are respectively adopted to predict greenhouse inside temperature based on the environmental information obtained including outside temperature, humidity(inside and outside), solar radiation,wind speed and direction. At last, the predicted inside temperature value is compared with the measured value, and the experiment results show that the prediction accuracy of BPNN is better than PLSR around the premise of both methods achieving the ideal effects. © 2016 TCCT.},

	abstract = {Over the last three decades the process industries have grown very rapidly, with corresponding increases in the quantities of hazardous materials in process, storage or transport. Plants have become larger and are often situated in or close to densely populated areas. Increased hazard of loss of life or property is continually highlighted with incidents such as Flixborough, Bhopal, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, the Phillips 66 incident, and Piper Alpha to name but a few.The field of Loss Prevention is, and continues to, be of supreme importance to countless companies, municipalities and governments around the world, because of the trend for processing plants to become larger and often be situated in or close to densely populated areas, thus increasing the hazard of loss of life or property. This book is a detailed guidebook to defending against these, and many other, hazards. It could without exaggeration be referred to as the "bible" for the process industries. This is THE standard reference work for chemical and process engineering safety professionals. For years, it has been the most complete collection of information on the theory, practice, design elements, equipment, regulations and laws covering the field of process safety. An entire library of alternative books (and cross-referencing systems) would be needed to replace or improve upon it, but everything of importance to safety professionals, engineers and managers can be found in this all-encompassing reference instead. Frank Lees' world renowned work has been fully revised and expanded by a team of leading chemical and process engineers working under the guidance of one of the worldâ??s chief experts in this field. Sam Mannan is professor of chemical engineering at Texas A and M University, and heads the Mary Kay Oâ??Connor Process Safety Center at Texas A and M. He received his MS and Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Oklahoma, and joined the chemical engineering department at Texas A and M University as a professor in 1997. He has over 20 years of experience as an engineer, working both in industry and academiaNew detail is added to chapters on fire safety, engineering, explosion hazards, analysis and suppression, and new appendices feature more recent disasters. The many thousands of references have been updated along with standards and codes of practice issued by authorities in the US, UK/Europe and internationally. In addition to all this, more regulatory relevance and case studies have been included in this edition. Written in a clear and concise style, Loss Prevention in the Process Industries covers traditional areas of personal safety as well as the more technological aspects and thus provides balanced and in-depth coverage of the whole field of safety and loss prevention. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In this study greenhouse tomato production was investigated from energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission point of views. Moreover, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) were employed to model energy consumption for greenhouse tomato production. Total energy input and output were calculated as 1,316.14 and 281.1 GJ ha-1. Among the all energy inputs, natural gas and electricity had the most significant contribution to the total energy input. Evaluations of GHG emission illustrated that the total GHG emission was estimated at 34,758.11 kg CO2eq ha-1 and, among all the inputs, electricity played the most important role, followed by natural gas. Comparison between ANN and ANFIS models showed that, due to employing fuzzy rules, the ANFIS-based models could model output energy more accurately than ANN models. Accordingly, correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for the best ANFIS architecture were calculated as 0.983, 0.025, and 0.149, respectively, while these performance parameters for the best ANN model were computed as 0.933, 0.05414, and 0.279, respectively. © 2015, Tarbiat Modares University.

Cases of a wheel rolling on both a road and on deformable ground are considered with particular emphasis on the identification of the friction and rolling resistance parameters in relation to environmental properties and tyre loading modes. The theory developed is illustrated by examples of cascade fuzzy observers using the off-board and on-board information space. To verify the proposed theoretical propositions, the work also contains the corresponding results of the hardware- and software-in-the-loop simulation. These fuzzy computing procedures can be used in various control systems of cars, off-road vehicles, and agricultural machines as well as in applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems.

However, the use of alternative fuels can strongly influence the performance of engines. The purpose of this study is to analyse the output and the pollutant emissions of a four-stroke SI engine fuelled with 0%, 50% and 80% bioethanol-gasoline blends. Tests were performed on a 3-kW engine used in broad applications. No specific modifications were applied to the carburetion system in order to evaluate its fuel flexibility capabilities. The tests evidenced that the mixture tends to get lean with alcoholic fuels; the brake specific fuel consumption increased due to the lower LHV of bioethanol, while the highest brake thermal efficiency was obtained with E50. Minor torque and power reductions were recorded with the ethanol blends. The concentration of UHC decreased with E50 and E80 while NOx emissions reduced because of the lower combustion temperature due to the bioethanol cooling effect and the leaner mixture. In contrast, the concentration of CO increased because a poor homogenization of the charge and a lower combustion temperature had facilitated the formation of partial oxidation products. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Although most commonly used in civil engineering, such as in roads, bridges, and dams, SHM is now finding applications in other engineering environments, such as naval and aerospace engineering. Written by a highly respected expert in the field, Structural Sensing, Health Monitoring, and Performance Evaluation provides the first comprehensive coverage of SHM. The text begins with a review of the various types of sensors currently used in SHM, including point sensors and noncontact systems. Subsequent chapters explain the processing and interpretation of data from a number of sensors working in parallel. After considering issues related to the structures themselves, the author surveys the design of a tailor-made SHM system. He also presents a collection of case studies, many of which are drawn from his own experiences. Exploring the power of sensors, this book shows how SHM technologies can be applied to a variety of structures and systems, including multistory buildings, offshore wind energy plants, and ecological systems. © 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {This book provides, for the first time, a broad and deep treatment of the fields of both ultra low power electronics and bioelectronics. It discusses fundamental principles and circuits for ultra low power electronic design and their applications in biomedical systems. It also discusses how ultra-energy-efficient cellular and neural systems in biology can inspire revolutionary low power architectures in mixed-signal and RF electronics. The book presents a unique, unifying view of ultra low power analog and digital electronics and emphasizes the use of the ultra-energy-efficient subthreshold regime of transistor operation in both. Chapters on batteries, energy harvesting, and the future of energy provide an understanding of fundamental relationships between energy use and energy generation at small scales and at large scales. A wealth of insights and examples from brain implants, cochlear implants, bio-molecular sensing, cardiac devices, and bio-inspired systems make the book useful and engaging for students and practicing engineers. Reviews: "Professor Sarpeshkar's textbook from MIT provides an excellent overview of ten key fundamental principles related to ultra low power circuit and system design. Examples of many practical, experimental micro-power systems in cardiac, neural, and other medical-electronics applications make the text highly useful. Practitioners in this field will gain insight from his system-level analysis, which is presented at a level deeper than that found in most texts. In fact, the focus on systems thinking and connections made to a diverse set of problems - natural and man-made, from medical implants, to cells, to low-power cars - truly sets this book apart." Dr. Tim Denison, Medtronic Fellow "This truly interdisciplinary book is about much more than circuits. It contains the most comprehensive and deep treatment I have seen of the interplay and parallels between biology and circuits, and of how one discipline can inform the other. The comparisons between analog, digital, and biological implementations are fundamental and highly valuable. The breadth of the book is unique, ranging from feedback and antennas to battery chemistry." Yannis Tsividis, Columbia University "Sarpeshkar's focus on modeling cells as analog rather than digital circuits offers a new approach that will expand the frontiers of synthetic biology. Rahul has nicely laid a foundation that many of us in synthetic biology will be able to build on." James Collins, Boston University. © Cambridge University Press 2010.},

	abstract = {The instant torque and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of a farm-tractor engine are very interesting parameters from a technical and economical point of view and allow advancing many considerations in the Engineering and Farm-mechanization fields related to the optimization of the engine power and consumptions. A direct access to the CAN-BUS system, where present, can be difficult; as a consequence, some practical solutions (sensors, numerical methodologies) aimed to deduce continuously but indirectly the engine performances are therefore proposed and discussed. In particular, the focus of this study is to evaluate the possibility of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with exhaust gas (EG) and motor oil temperature data, easy to be measured. Hence, the above-mentioned temperatures and several network architectures (different for neurons and hidden layers number, neuronal transfer functions) were evaluated in their reliability in estimating the torque and BSFC of different tractor diesel motors, giving also the readers some useful indications: determination coefficients were calculated with reference to the line "predicted values = experimental values". Lubricant temperature resulted to be totally unsuitable (very low and diversified R2). ANNs using the EG temperature for torque estimations achieved higher average R2 than ANNs predicting BSFC, both in the training (>0.996 vs. >0.889) and in the prediction phase (>0.993 vs. >0.621). Consequently, EG temperature is strongly recommended for estimating both parameters even if preliminary evaluations should be performed for BSFC (engine characteristics have a significant influence on the predictions). Finally, best R2 can be scored by using the Gaussian neuronal transfer function. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A tractor-mounted, automated soil penetrometer-shearometer unit was designed and developed for the purpose of simultaneous in situ measurements of soil penetration resistance and shear stress. The automated soil penetrometer-shearometer unit utilises both commercial penetrometer and shearometer. The overall construction of the unit was made up of the main frame to support the moving carriage sub-assemblies, two moving carriage sub-assemblies to support penetrometer and shearometer, the gear driving mechanisms to support the traverse movements of the moving carriages, and the three-point hitch attachment to support the main frame and provide attachment to the tractor. The motion controls for the penetrometer-shearometer unit were performed by the programmable logic controller (PLC) unit and other external electronics and sensing devices. Two high-torque stepper motors were used to drive the penetrometer and shearometer moving carriages in the vertical axis direction while another one low-torque stepper motor was used to drive the rotating spindle of the shearometer. A personal computer data acquisition and differential global positioning system (DGPS) on-board tractor were used to assist in real-time measuring, displaying, and recording the tractor position, soil penetration resistance, and soil shear stress during the field sampling operation. Field test of the automated soil penetrometer-shearometer unit was conducted together with data collection on soil moisture content, terrain slope, and tractor-implement performance parameters. Spatial maps produced from the collected data showed considerable site-specific variation in the measured parameters over the field. Statistical analysis showed significant correlation between soil penetration resistance and shear stress and significant correlation between soil moisture content with penetration resistance and shear stress. Multiple regression equations were formulated using the stepwise analysis method to predict travel speed, implement draught and fuel consumption for mouldboard ploughing on Serdang sandy clay loam soil. © 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

	abstract = {Urban road traffic is highly dynamic. Traffic conditions vary in time and with location and so do the movement patterns of individual road users. In this article, a movement pattern is the behaviour of a car when traversing a road link in an urban road network. A movement pattern can be recorded with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). A movement pattern has a specific energy-efficiency, which is a measure of how fuel-intensively the car is moving. For example, a car driving uniformly at medium speed consumes little fuel and, therefore, is energy-efficient, whereas stop-and-go driving consumes much fuel and is energy-inefficient. In this article we introduce a model to estimate the energy-efficiency of movement patterns in urban road traffic from GNSS data. First, we derived statistical features about the car's movement along the road. Then, we compared these to fuel consumption data from the car's controller area network (CAN) bus, normalized to the car's overall range of fuel consumption. We identified the optimal feature set for prediction. With the optimal feature set we trained, tested and verified a model to estimate energy-efficiency, with the fuel consumption serving as ground truth. Existing fuel consumption models usually view movement as a snapshot. Thus, the behaviour of the car remains unknown that causes a movement pattern to be energy-efficient or energy-inefficient. Our model views movement as a process and allows to interpret this process. A movement pattern can, for example, be energy-inefficient because the car is driving in stop-and-go traffic, because it is travelling at high speed, or because it is accelerating. Our model allows to distinguish between these different types of behaviours. Thus, it can provide new insights into the dynamics of urban road traffic and its energy-efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

One possible way to conserve energy is the use of low-frequency analog-to-digital conversion devices and associated data sampling techniques. In this paper, a new approach to lowering sampling frequency using model-based data imputation is proposed and discussed. Recorded data is used to develop models based on time-delay recurrent neural network. While sampling at low frequencies, the models are used to predict future and missing values. The models are updated when predicted values differ significantly from the actual measurements. The proposed approach is demonstrated using actual measurements sampled at different frequencies. The results are thoroughly analyzed from the perspective of approximation error and energy savings. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to predict the grain yield of irrigated wheat in Abyek town of Ghazvin province, Iran. Due to large number of inputs (eight inputs) for ANFIS, the input vector was clustered into two groups and two networks were trained. Inputs for ANFIS 1 were diesel fuel, fertilizer and electricity energies and for ANFIS 2 were human labor, machinery, chemicals, water for irrigation and seed energies. The RMSE and R2 values were found 0.013 and 0.996 for ANFIS 1 and 0.018 and 0.992 for ANFIS 2, respectively. These results showed that ANFIS 1 and ANFIS 2 could well predict the yield. Finally, the predicted values of the two networks were used as inputs to the third ANFIS. The results indicated that the energy inputs in ANFIS 1 have a greater impact on the final yield production than other energy inputs. Also, the RMSE and R2 values for ANFIS 3 were 0.013 and 0.996, respectively. These results showed that ANFIS 1 and the combined network (ANFIS 3) could both predict the grain yield with good accuracy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Analyses of plants' geometrical shape is of great value for many precision agriculture methodologies. Among them is the estimation of growth parameters which provide the basis for biological modeling and site-specific management. Single-image 2D-based analysis is the commonly applied approach for parameter estimation, but its accuracy is affected by imaging position, plant density (e.g., overlapping canopies), and species that share similar canopy architecture. With today's rapid increase in computational power, stereovision modeling has become an attractive alternative for providing detailed 3D plant models. Nonetheless, the existing modeling approaches are limited in handling multiple species and growth stages, and their accuracy is affected by outdoor illumination. Moreover, they can only provide directly estimated parameters (height and leaf cover), whereas the important matter of biomass is ignored. This study proposes a novel approach for 3D plant modeling. The reconstruction stage of the model integrates local and global optimization criteria, which enables handling the challenging low textures inherent to plant scenes. In addition, it uses hue-invariant transformation for plant extraction, which has been proven robust for field illuminations. The model provides a detailed 3D reconstruction of plants' shapes as a basis for estimating their growth parameters, including biomass. The generalized nature of its performance was proven by reconstructing the geometric shapes of different plant species at different growth stages, from young seedlings to fully developed plants. Its generalized use does not require any particular setups or adaptations, and accurate estimations of plant height (error ~4%) and leaf cover area (error ~4.5%) were obtained. Furthermore, a strong correlation (R2~0.94) was found between the plant's measured biomass and its estimated volume, which provided an accurate estimate of biomass (error ~4%) in the validation tests. Since the proposed 3D modeling approach is inexpensive, accessible and efficiently processed, it can be implemented from agricultural vehicles for real-time applications. © 2013.},
